Saturn 24, 3400 Cluj-Napoca, Romania\nflorian@coneural.org\nAbstract\nScience, like any other cognitive activity, is\ngrounded in the sensorimotor interaction of\nour bodies with the environment. Human em-\nbodiment thus constrains the class of scien-\ntific concepts and theories which are accessi-\nble to us. The paper explores the possibil-\nity of doing science with artificial cognitive\nagents, in the framework of an interactivist-\nconstructivist cognitive model of science. In-\ntelligent robots, by virtue of having different\nsensorimotor capabilities, may overcome the\nfundamental limitations of human science and\nprovide important technological innovations.\nMathematics and nanophysics are prime can-\ndidates for being studied by artificial scien-\ntists.\n1. Introduction\nScience is one of the highest achievements of hu-\nman cognition, and its technological applications are\ncertainly extremely important to human civilization.\nThis paper argues that, in spite of the impressive re-\nsults achieved so far, human science has fundamen-\ntal limitations, given by our embodiment. In order\nto ensure the unconstrained advancement of science,\nintelligent robots capable of doing science should be\nbuilt.\nFirst, we briefly present an interactivist - construc-\ntivist cognitive model of science. It sets a framework\nfor discussing the capabilities of cognitive agents\nneeded for doing science and the relationship be-\ntween science and embodiment. We introduce next\nartificially made science and argue that it may over-\ncome the limitations of human science. Mathematics\nseems to be the field for which it is easiest to build\nartificial scientists, but their most important contri-\nbution will be in domains distant from human sen-\nsorimotor experience, such as nanotechnology. We\nalso compare the current approach to artificial sci-\nence with previous work in the field of automated\nscience and machine discovery.\n2. Science – a cognitive point of view\nScience is a systematic process by which we come\nto understand the structure of the surrounding en-\nvironment, to generate predictions about evolutions\nand explanations of causality in this environment.\nSocial factors influence the evolution of science, by\nestablishing socially accepted truth, setting research\nagendas and through the communication of scientific\nresults. But before science becomes a social issue,\nscientific concepts and theories must be generated,\nunderstood and verified by the scientists themselves.\nHere the focus will be on the cognitive properties of\na single individual needed for science.\n2.1 Interactionist-constructivist cognition\nThe cognitive model of cognition presented here\nhas as epistemological framework the interactionist-\nconstructivist model of cognition of Indurkhya\n(1992), originally developed for explaining the un-\nderstanding of similarity creating metaphors. Ac-\ncording to this theory, reality does not have a mind-\nindependent ontology: the concepts of the cognitive\nagent impose an ontology to the world. The concepts\nare internal to the agent and generated by its senso-\nrimotor interaction with the environment. However,\nthe structure of the world with respect to this on-\ntology cannot be arbitrary: reality has a structure\nexternal to the cognitive agent. It is autonomous\nand manifested in the structure of the sensorimotor\ndata set, directly accessible to the agent. We may\nassume that reality exists prior to conceptualization,\nbut its ontology does not.\nWhile some of the empirical findings that moti-\nvated these considerations come from cognitive an-\nthropology and psychology (Indurkhya, 1992, pp.\n94–111), this theory is also largely compatible with\nthe results of modern science. It has been estab-\nlished that it is pointless to look for the final the-\nory of the world, the final truth, which would be\nthe equivalent of discovering its “real” ontology. A\nscientific theory can only be refuted, not justified,\nand may be considered valid only until its refuta-\ntion. This follows not only from theoretical consider-\nations (Popper, 1959), but was also shown by mod-\nern physics (Feynman, 1992, chap. 7). Moreover,\na theory should only approximate relevant aspects\nof reality, balancing predictive power with complex-\nity, otherwise its details would be unmanageable for\nour finite cognitive capabilities (Tolman, 1932). A\nscientific theory is however useful for its coherence\n(viability, functional fitness) with a limited domain\nof the world (see also Peschl, 2001). Quantum me-\nchanics and the theory of relativity are incompatible\ntheories, with different ontologies; however, they are\nboth accepted as valid theories for their explanatory\ndomain. But scientific theories cannot be arbitrary:\nnature resists their predictions. The result of an ex-\nperiment is given solely by the structure of reality.\nAs we will show later, an interactionist - construc-\ntivist model of cognition also agrees with the latest\nresults in neuroscience and cognitive science.\n2.2 Neurobiological foundations for knowl-\nedge and science\nIt is generally accepted that the biological basis of\ncognition is the neuronal activity. Part of the in-\nteraction of the environment with the organism is\ncaptured by sensors and is translated in neuronal\npatterns of activation. Activation of motor neurons\nresults in actions that are externalized in the envi-\nronment and may change it, or change its perception\nby the agent (as in a movement). Synapses transmit\nneuronal activation to other neurons, and in general\nit is sustained even in the absence of significant sen-\nsorial input.\nQuasi-hebbian learning, associating concomitant\nactivations, is widely considered as an important\nlearning mechanism in biological neural networks\nand it was demonstrated experimentally in some ar-\neas of the mammalian brain (Kandel, Schwartz, &\nJessel, 2000, chap. 63; Rolls & Treves, 1998, chap.\n1; Fuster, 1995, chap. 3). In general, learning corre-\nsponds to changes in the chemical composition of the\nneuronal environment, and modifications of synap-\ntic strengths and synaptic connectivity. Long term\nmodifications in the synaptic connectivity yields a\nneural constructivism (Quartz and Sejnowski, 1997)\nthat mirrors and is the physical basis of the con-\nceptual one. These changes are caused by the neu-\nral activity, which is largely environmentally de-\nrived: learning and cognitive development in biolog-\nical agents is thus inextricably related to their senso-\nrimotor capabilities, and thus to their embodiment\n(see also Tolman, 1932, Gibson, 1979, MacDorman\net al., 2000).\nThe representational properties of the brain, which\nare mostly a result of learning, thus also largely de-\npend on the sensorimotor capabilities of the sup-\nporting body. Moreover, it is believed that im-\nagery and short term memory share many com-\nmon neural mechanisms with perception or motor\naction (Kosslyn and Thompson, 2000, Fuster, 1995,\nJeannerod, 1994, Jeannerod, 1999). Many results\npoint out that the neural correlates of a cer-\ntain concept, activated, for example, by a word,\nare activations of the neural networks that were\nalso active during the experiences of the person\nwith the significant of that word (Damasio, 1990,\nPulvermuller, 1999, Martin et al., 2000). The rep-\nresentational properties of a symbol cannot thus\ngo further than the perceptual, motor or emo-\ntional states that are associated by learning with\nthe phonological or visual form of the sym-\nbol. It was argued that even the understanding\nof abstract concepts is ultimately grounded like\nthis (Barsalou, 1999). Such grounded representa-\ntions are internal to the cognitive agent, and do\nnot have the shortcomings of the classical sym-\nbolic representations (Harnad, 1990, Bickhard, 1993,\nPfeifer and Scheier, 1999, Ziemke, 2001). Further\nassociations between symbols are also possible, but\nultimately their representational content will be\ngrounded in the sensorimotor states associated with\nthem.\nThese facts seem to confirm an interactivist-\nconstructivist view of cognition: representations de-\npend on the interaction of the cognitive agent with\nthe external environment and are constructed ac-\ncording to his individual history of interactions. Pre-\nvious experiences induce long term changes in the\nsynaptic connectivity, and thus each perception is\ninfluenced by the past. Each agent thus has a differ-\nent ontology of the world, the differences being at-\ntenuated only by genetically induced similarities be-\ntween bodies, commonality of the environments and\nby communication.\nMotor capability is of the utmost importance for\nthe possibility of representation for the cognitive\nagent himself (in contrast to the representation for\nthe user and designer, as in classical symbol-based\nartificial intelligence). Bickhard (1993) argues on\ntheoretical grounds that genuine representational\ncontent can be generated only by an embodied, ac-\ntion capable, goal directed agent. This content is\nin fact the potentialities for action activated by the\ncurrent perceptual input and by the internal state of\nan agent (which correspond to the “behavioral pos-\nsibilities” of Tolman, 1932, and to the “affordances”\nof Gibson, 1979). In robotics, the importance\nof sensorimotor coordination was demonstrated for\nsolving the problems that appear in information\nprocessing approaches (Pfeifer and Scheier, 1999,\nSteels and Brooks, 1995).\nIn the primate brain, the main locus of integration\nbetween the perceptual and the motor pathways is\nthe prefrontal cortex, which is considered essential\nfor certain types of memory, but also for planning,\ninitiation of action, and creativity (Fuster, 1995).\nOn one hand, associations between perceptual and\nsensorimotor networks capture part of the environ-\nment structure, together with the structure that may\nbe detected from a static sensorial input or from the\ntemporal changes of sensorial input. On the other\nhand, mutual activations between these networks\nmay allow planning of actions by mental simulation\nand the prediction of results. For example, it was ex-\nperimentally shown that visuomotor anticipation—\nthe prediction of the visual consequences of a fu-\nture motor action—is likely to be also the mechanism\nthat drives mental rotation (Wexler et al., 1998). It\nis thus possible for the cognitive agent to internally\nsimulate and predict the evolution of the environ-\nment in reaction to a given action or to a chain of\nactions. Causality may also be represented, alter-\nnatively, by direct associations between cause and\nresult, without temporal continuity.\n2.3 A cognitive model of science\nWe are now close to introducing science in this pic-\nture. The technological breakthroughs made pos-\nsible by science in the last few centuries are rela-\ntively recent on evolutionary timescales. The cog-\nnitive mechanisms that allow us to do science could\nnot be favored by evolution for science itself. Those\nmechanisms must thus be the same as those involved\nin more mundane, though evolutionary adaptive,\ncognitive processes (Nersessian, 1992, Peschl, 1999,\nPeschl, 2001). Some of these mechanisms are:\n• Causality detection and mental simulation. Re-\npeated associations between actions and per-\nceptions of the results, or between evolution\nin time of perceptions, may yield permanent\nassociations under the form of causality rela-\ntions. Further, once these causalities are learned,\none may mentally simulate chains of actions\nand their causally related results to construct\nplans of actions and predict results of these\nplans. This is an adaptive mechanism, which\nmay be found also in animals, and which serves\nin science as a basis for causality detection and\nthe formulation of predictions. Computational\nmodeling of simulation and prediction based\non sensorimotor experience is an active field of\nresearch (Jirenhed et al., 2001, Stojanov, 2001,\nMacDorman et al., 2000, Clark, 2001).\n• Coherence detection. When executing a mentally\nsimulated plan, the result may or may not be the\nsame as what was planned. It is adaptive for the\nagent to evaluate the coherence of the predicted\nand actual result and to consequently enforce the\ncausal associations used in the plan, or alterna-\ntively to loose them, or to explain the result with\nan alternative causal chain.\n• Projective reasoning. This comprises the type of\nreasoning used for the understanding and gener-\nation of similes, analogies, metaphors and mod-\nels. It may be considered a “projection” of the\nstructure of a source domain on a target domain\n(Indurkhya, 1992). While a definite, biologically\nplausible model of this phenomenon remains to\nbe developed, we may speculate that it arises\nfrom simultaneous activation of the neural net-\nworks activated with the source and target do-\nmain. The common features of the two domains\nare revealed, if there are any. If the target domain\nhas little sensorimotor structure associated with\nit, the structure of the source domain will dom-\ninate the conceptualization of the target. How-\never, an asymmetry between the source and the\ntarget domain always exists during a metaphor\nor an analogy, and a mechanism that accounts\nfor it has to be determined. Emergent capability\nfor projective reasoning should be an important\ntest for every model of human knowledge repre-\nsentation.\nReasoning by analogy is also an adaptive mech-\nanism, as it may suggest ways to deal with\nnew situations, based on experience acquired\nwith previous situations. While nonhuman pri-\nmates can successfully reason analogically af-\nter training only, young children do it naturally\n(Holyoak and Thagard, 1996) and have no prob-\nlems understanding metaphors.\n• Abstraction. Abstraction implies extraction of\ncommon sensorimotor structure and may be re-\nlated to categorization, which is easily obtained\nwith neural networks. Another type of abstrac-\ntion is related to the schematicity of concepts\n(Barsalou, 1999), which is implicitly realized if\nthe concepts are grounded in distributed neural\nnetworks.\n• Symbolic association. This capability may have\nevolved for communication, which is also an\nadaptive mechanism.\n• Subitizing. It was shown that newborns and\nsome animals are capable to precisely and in-\nstantly discriminate (without counting) between\nsmall quantities, up to numbers of the or-\nder of 4 or 5 (Wynn, 1993, Dehaene, 1997).\nThe numerosity of greater quantities can be\nalso imprecisely estimated by animals, the vari-\nability being proportional with the magnitude\n(Gallistel and Gelman, 2000). This is also an\nadaptive mechanism, which may be used to boot-\nstrap the understanding of numbers. Subitiz-\ning was simulated with connectionist models\n(Dehaene and Changeux, 1993).\nOut of these mechanisms, the most important is\nprobably the projective reasoning, as it allows the\nformation of theories and the reasoning about do-\nmains of reality where there is no direct sensorimotor\naccess. Through projective reasoning, the structure\nof a (source) domain, learned by sensorimotor in-\nteraction with it, is projected to a different (target)\ndomain. If the projection is coherent with the target\ndomain, it may allow predictions, through simula-\ntions that follow the sensorimotor associations in the\nsource domain. Moreover, the source domain can in-\nduce a different structure in the target domain, thus\ninducing a creative conceptualization of this domain\n(Indurkhya, 1992).\nFor example, we may know that if we put a cup of\nwater in the fridge, or if we put it outside in the win-\nter, it will transform into ice. A sensorimotor con-\nceptualization of this target domain would involve\nassociations between the perception of cold, visual\nand tactile perceptions of water and ice, the motor\nactions involved in the experiment, other associa-\ntions with previous encounters with water and ice,\nand so on. However, we may also think about this\nphenomenon in the terms of the molecular structure\nof water: the solidification would thus be seen as a\nchange in the movement of the molecules. The source\ndomain would be here spatial perception (we would\nimagine the molecules ranged orderly in three dimen-\nsional space) and the sensorimotor interactions with\nobjects, which serve as a source for the conceptual-\nization of the molecules. The sensorimotor ground-\ning of the source domain is thus different than the\none of the target domain, and through projection it\nimposes a new conceptualization of water and ice.\nThe mechanism of projective reasoning may\nexplain also the incommensurability of different\nparadigms (Kuhn, 1962). If in different paradigms\nthere are different source domains that structure the\ntarget domain, and if there are no similarities be-\ntween the different source domains that could be ab-\nstracted, there is simply no way to reconcile the two\nviews: they are simply different and activate differ-\nent neural networks. Projective reasoning also intro-\nduces an extra degree of variability in the ontology of\nthe world, which has special importance in science:\nthe ontology not only depends on the experiential\nhistory of the cognitive agent, but also on which sen-\nsorimotor domain it is grounded on, and in which\nway.\nAbstraction is another important cognitive mech-\nanism used in science. For example, the concept\nof number is abstracted from the manipulation and\nconstruction of objects, measurement of linear di-\nmensions and quantities, and movement on a path\n(Lakoff and Nunez, 2000). They are several differ-\nent sensorimotor domains, but they have a certain\ncommon structure that is abstracted in the con-\ncept of number. This structure is also associated\nwith subitizing mechanisms, counting, and the dif-\nferent forms of symbolic representation of numbers\n(Dehaene, 2000, Pesenti et al., 2000, Dehaene, 1992,\nDehaene and Cohen, 1995).\nIn general, the structure of a source domain has a\ncertain plasticity; some new associations are added,\nand some older associations are inhibited, after the\napplication in a target domain. This modified struc-\nture may be abstracted, or restructured with a pro-\njection from another domain, in a more and more\nelaborated construction that eventually leads to the\ncreation and understanding of modern scientific con-\ncepts.\nScience is thus the process of selecting source do-\nmains and adapting their structure, initially acquired\nfrom sensorimotor processes, such as the resulting\nstructure is coherent with the structure of a certain\ndomain of the environment where is no direct senso-\nrimotor access, or where the sensorimotor generated\nstructure is not rich enough. The projected struc-\nture of the source domain allows mental simulations,\nwhich yield predictions in the target domain.\n3. Limitations of human science\nHuman scientific concepts thus crucially depend on\nhuman sensorimotor capabilities, given by the hu-\nman body. The limited range of these sensorimo-\ntor capabilities thus fundamentally limits the class\nof abstract concepts, including scientific concepts,\nthat a human can understand and use. The ani-\nmal world exemplifies some biologically implemented\nsensorial capabilities that are beyond human expe-\nrience, such as space perception through sonar-like\ninteractions, magnetoreception and electroreception\n(Hughes, 1999). Presumably, if we had these per-\nceptual pathways in addition to our current ones,\ntheories about waves and electromagnetism would\nhave been much simpler to generate and acquire, and\nmuch closer to our intuition.\nArtifacts obtained with current technologies may\nextend further the domain, spectral range, preci-\nsion and intensity of receptors and effectors. Mea-\nsurement instruments that use those enhanced sen-\nsors and effectors are routinely used in science. Via\ntransductors, the signals can be perceived by the\nhuman sensorimotor apparatus, and human move-\nments can be translated to other types of ac-\ntions, thus leading to novel sensorimotor couplings,\nwhich may associate an extra sensorimotor ground-\ning with the theories. For example, it was argued\nthat tools extend action and perception capabilities\n(Hirose, 2002). The sensorimotor contingencies gen-\nerated by the use of tools and instruments integrate\nsmoothly, after training, with the sensorimotor con-\ntingencies of our own body (O’Regan and Noe, 2001,\nStojanov and Gerbino, 1999).\nHowever, current scientific theories constrain the\ndesign of the experimental apparatus, and the output\nof the measurement instruments has to be accessible\nto human sensors. The expansion of this productive\ncycle, from theories to new sensorimotor groundings\nand back, thus cannot fully escape the limitations of\nhuman body.\nOther limitations of human science may come from\nlimits of short-term memory and slow reasoning per-\nformance (Riegler, 1998). General limitations of hu-\nman cognition were also discussed by McGinn (1994).\n4. Artificial science\n4.1 Introducing artificial scientists\nHaving reviewed the cognitive capabilities needed for\nscience, it is naturally to ask if it is possible to im-\nplement them in artificial cognitive agents. It seems\nthat there is, in principle, no impediment for such\nagents to develop science—artificial science.\nAs discussed in Section 2.3, they would have to\nbe embodied and to have both sensors and effectors.\nThey will conceptualize on their own their environ-\nment. At first, this conceptualization will be through\nsensorimotor interaction. Later, these sensorimotor\nstructures generated for some domains of the envi-\nronment may be projected on other domains. As\nhuman science has shown, if the structure of the sen-\nsorimotor data set is rich enough, it may be coherent\nwith other structures from other parts of the environ-\nment. We may ensure this emergent phenomenon in\nthe artificial scientists by giving them access to a\ncomplex environment and to a wide range of sensors\nand effectors. The control apparatus of the agents,\nwhich would probably be implemented in artificial\nneural networks, will have to implement causality de-\ntection, internal simulation, abstraction, projective\nreasoning and eventually symbolic association. In\nbiological agents, the need for coherence is imposed\nby their need for survival: a lack of coherence may\nresult in injuries or death. In the artificial agents,\nthe goal may be simply to maximize the coherence\nand the diversity of their predictions. Alternatively,\ntheir goal may be to conceive and later build tech-\nnological applications of their science. In this way,\nthey may generate technological innovations.\nFor example, with the recent advent of nanotech-\nnology, cognitive agents could be build that would\nhave direct perceptual access to quantum phenom-\nena. Quantum mechanics would then be at least as\neasy to understand for them as classical mechanics\nis for humans. Moreover, it is possible that their\nconception of quantum mechanics would be much\nsimpler than the conception that humans painfully\nacquire through an elaborate construction from an\nunadapted grounding. This new way of conceiving\nquantum phenomena may lead to novel applications.\nIn general, having a different embodiment, the ar-\ntificial agents will have access to different classes of\nconcepts than the one available in human science.\nThe science generated by artificial agents will thus\nescape the limits imposed by the human body.\nOnce enough of the structure of the environment is\nacquired through sensorimotor interaction, the artifi-\ncial scientist could also continue the scientific process\nof searching coherences “oﬄine”, without permanent\ninteraction with the environment.\n4.2 Communication between humans and\nartificial scientists\nAs in any other communication between two agents\nwith different types of bodies, the communication\nbetween humans and the artificial scientists may\nprove difficult. We will not be able to understand\nin their entirety the conceptualizations of the artifi-\ncial agents. Understanding an utterance means an\ninternal simulation involving the sensorimotor sig-\nnificants of the communicated symbols, previously\nlearned by association. As the sensorimotor ground-\nings of the agents are different than ours, there will\nbe an important loss of information in the commu-\nnication between the two parties. The situation may\nbe different if the environment and the sensorimotor\ncapabilities of the agents are moderately similar to\nthe human ones.\n4.3 Artificial mathematics\nMany results point out that the groundings of hu-\nman mathematics are mainly the conceptualiza-\ntion of space and objects. A brain imagery study\n(Dehaene et al., 1999) has shown that arithmetic\nuses bilateral areas of the parietal lobes involved in\nvisuo-spatial processing, for estimation of numeri-\ncal magnitudes, besides part of the brain involved in\nword association, for the addition tables. Lakoff and\nNunez (1999, 2000) have theoretically studied the\nembodiment of the mathematical concepts. Their\nresults also point to the (active) perception of space\nand objects as the grounding of mathematics. Many\npsychological experiments have shown a strong cor-\nrelation between spatial abilities and mathematical\nand scientific abilities (Siemankowski and MacK-\nnight, 1971, Poole and Stanley, 1972, Bishop, 1973,\nGuay and MacDaniel, 1977, Mitchelmore, 1980, Pall-\nrand and Seeber, 1984). It seems thus that an arti-\nficial agent that will acquire an accurate conceptual-\nization of space and object perception and manipu-\nlation, through sensorimotor interaction, and which\nwill also have symbolic capabilities, will be able to\nunderstand and generate mathematics, and eventu-\nally, later, classical mechanics.\nThere already exist many neuroscience results\nabout space and object perception, as they may be\ncollected also from direct brain recordings from an-\nimals. They may guide the realization of the artifi-\ncial mathematician. The discreteness of mathemat-\nics, based on the discreteness of objects, may ease\nthe communication between the agent and humans.\nThe results of human mathematics may be communi-\ncated to the artificial mathematician, and at its turn\nit may provide us its innovative results. Finally, the\nresult would be an artifact that would be able to mas-\nter the whole human mathematics and continuously\ngenerate new mathematical results (which yields the\nquestion, maybe senseless until now, if interesting\nmathematics could ever be complete, or infinitely\nnew important results may be generated). The arti-\nficial mathematician will be able to escape the limits\nof Go¨del’s theorem, as a human mathematician does,\nbecause its demonstrations will not be limited to the\nuse of a single grounding. Through projective rea-\nsoning, it will be able to change groundings, and use\nresults from a grounding in different ones, as a hu-\nman does.\n4.4 Comparison with previous approaches\nThere is an important volume of work in artificial in-\ntelligence dedicated to the computational discovery\nof new scientific knowledge. Some of this work was\nsuccessful and concluded with publications in spe-\nciality journals of the scientific results discovered by\nthe programs (for reviews, see Langley, 2000, Lang-\nley, 1998, Colton and Steel, 1999, Valdes-Perez, 1999,\nLangley et al., 1993). However, this work is only su-\nperficially similar with the approach proposed here.\nIn general, previous approaches to machine discovery\nor automated science were concerned with clustering,\nsearching of qualitative and quantitative laws, and\nformulation of models, always using human provided\ndata. It is up to the developer of the automated\ndiscovery program to choose a problem formulation\nadapted to the input data, and also to choose a rep-\nresentation for the data fed to the program. Often,\nthe input data is preprocessed and filtered by the de-\nveloper, and the developer manipulates the program\nalgorithm to modulate its performance for certain\ninputs (Langley, 2000).\nIn most cases, the program has no effectors and\nhas no access to the environmental phenomena stud-\nied, other than the preprocessed data. An exception\nis a project of closed-loop scientific discovery, where\nexperiments are planned automatically and carried\nout by robots (Bryant et al., 2001); that paper also\nintroduces the term “artificial scientist”. However,\nin all cases the ontology of the world, as seen by the\nprogram carrying out the automatic scientific discov-\nery work, is fixed by its human developer.\nIn contrast, the approach presented here suggests\nthat the most interesting fact about doing science\nwith robots is that they are able to come up with\nnovel ontologies of the world, by virtue of having an\nembodiment different than the human one. This is\nwhy they should have both perceptual and effector\naccess to the phenomena they study, and the capa-\nbility to conceptualize on their own the environment,\naccording to their sensorimotor affordances.\n5. Conclusion\nThe paper presented a cognitive model of science and\na blueprint for artificial scientists. While they are\nsometimes speculative, they open a research direc-\ntion that may finally yield important technological\napplications. Results from neuroscience, artificial life\nand robotics accumulate at a fast rate, and may soon\nprove that the construction of an artificial mathe-\nmatician is a question of years.\n6.

    "fullText": "Early imitation and the emergence of a sense of\nagency\nJacqueline Nadel\nCNRS UMR7593, Hoˆpital La Salpeˆtrie`re\nParis, France\ne-mail: jnadel@ext.jussieu.fr\nIn this paper, I would like to emphasize the de-\nvelopmental role of imitation as a foundation for the\nemergence of a sense of agency (i.e. a sense of being\nthe owner of one’s own action). There is a large body\nof psychological and neuroimaging experiments that\nhave demonstrated that perception of action share\nsome common neural and cognitive mechanisms with\naction generation, action simulation, action recogni-\ntion and action imitation. How the concept of shared\nmotor representations relate to neonatal imitation is\nof major interest. Indeed, primary wired perceptual-\nmotor coupling may be viewed as primitives of imita-\ntion which could play a main constitutive role in the\nestablishment of a distinction between action origi-\nnating from self and action originating from others.\nWe will show that 2-month-olds do not imitate a self-\npropelled robotic mouth protruding its tongue, while\nthey do imitate a human tongue protrusion. This\nsuggests that imitation is already selective of human\naction. Young infants select biological movements\namong all moving stimuli that are similar in speed,\ncolour and morphology.\nSimilarly, be imitated may be viewed as an action-\nperception coupling which may strongly contribute\nto distinguish between self-agency and other’s\nagency. In her first developmental steps, the very\nyoung infant may take the behaviour seen as being\nhers, which could result in reciprocal imitation if the\nmovement seen does not match exactly the move-\nment done. Through imitation, this will lead the\ninfant to distinguish between two classes of percep-\ntion that Russell proposes to be at the origin of the\nsense of agency: those perceptions that are a by-\nproduct of one’s own action and intention, and per-\nceptions coming from the external world, that you\ncannot modify at will. Comparing 2-month-olds’ be-\nhavior with a device allowing to present with a seam-\nless shift contingent image and voice of the mother or\ndelayed image and/or voice of the mother, we found\n10 times more imitation in the contingent episode,\nwhere infant and mother can reciprocate imitation\nrounds. In addition, a high positive correlation be-\ntween number of mother’s imitation and number of\ninfant’s imitation was found. This suggests that im-\nFigure 1: The teleprompter device used to delay im-\nage and/or voice of the mother (Nadel, Prepin & Canet,\n2004)\nitation begets imitation early after birth.\nIn the past we have shown that synchronic imi-\ntation and imitation recognition allow preverbal in-\nfants to find common topics based on similar actions,\nand to take conversational turns by alternating the\nroles of imitator and model. Therefore the gap be-\ntween recognizing actions and coding messages with\ncommunicative intent is not as enormous as it looks\nat first glance: Understanding the other’s intentional\nactions is prepared by the use of the imitative sys-\ntem, via the action recognition mechanism\nOur experiments led in socially embedded sit-\nuations have shown that nonverbal children with\nautism - even very low-functioning children - mostly\nproduce spontaneous imitations when meeting a non\nautistic child or a playful adult.

Theory grounding is the \nidea that we can imbue our embodied artificially \nintelligent systems with theories by modeling the way \nhumans, and specifically young children, develop skills \nwith theories. Modeling theory development promises to \nincrease the conceptual and behavioral flexibility of these \nsystems. An example of theory development in children is \nthe social understanding referred to as “theory of mind.” \nLanguage is a natural task for theory grounding because \nit is vital in symbolic skills and apparently necessary in \ndeveloping theories. Word learning, and specifically \ndeveloping a concept of words, is proposed as the first \nstep in a theory grounded theory of language. \n \n1. Introduction \n \nSymbol grounding, as defined by [19], has stimulated \nmuch thought and associated work has led to advances in \nartificial intelligence (AI). For example, behavior-based \nrobotic systems ground their reactive controllers using \nsensors and enable coordination of various levels of \nactivity patterns such as standing up, walking, and \nprowling ([4]). The vision though, of symbol grounding, \nhas barely begun to be tapped. Symbolic skills imply a far \ngreater cognitive capacity than just connecting a few layers \nof abstraction in a robot to a sensori-motor system. The \nrichness of conceptual structure, linguistic flexibility, and \nadaptation, all considered to be aspects of symbol usage \n([19]; [25]; [28]), should be a driving force behind our \neventual goals related to grounding symbols. \nIn establishing a sensory connection of the world to \nsymbols, [19] initiated our train of thought. To pursue a \nbroader and more human sense of symbol, one including \nthe conceptual and linguistic flexibility we tend to expect \nand retaining the ideas already present in symbol \ngrounding, we have introduced the idea of theory \ngrounding. Theory grounding ([33]; [34]) suggests that \nenabling our embodied AI systems to acquire theories can \nprovide greater generalization and adaptability. In terms of \nsymbol grounding, we propose that symbols dont fully \nbecome symbols in a situated or robotic system until they \nare part of a theorya system enabling inferences over \nvarious kinds of states, events, and actions, which can be \nused to make predictions (e.g., [32]). \nTheories are used formally and informally by adult \nhumans. As adults we reap many benefits by using \ntheories. We can simulate, in our minds, the effects of \nactions, construct predictions, and let our [mistaken] \nhypotheses  die in our stead (p. 375, [9], citing \nPopper). Our theories help us in reasoning about many \ndomains spanning the physical, social, and psychological \nworlds ([8]; [17]; [42]). The skills underpinning theory \nusage in adults have a basis in our development as young \nchildren. For example, in developing from age three to \nfour, human children advance in their social understanding \nand their reasoning changes in a marked way. They change \nfrom reasoning based on object-specific desires to \nreasoning about propositional beliefs and desires ([42]). At \nfour years of age children start to understand that they and \nothers can not only represent but also misrepresent the \nworld ([30]). These and related skills have been called \ntheory of mind ([32]; [42]). Theory changes are key to \nthe development of theory skills. Theory skills come into \nplay in children through a series of interwoven cognitive \nand linguistic developments. We propose that precisely \nthese changes can guide us in theory grounding. By \nmodeling the development of theoretical skills in a young \nchild, we hope to enable a progression, from an initial \nendowment (e.g., preprogramming), to a system that can \nflexibly deploy theory acquisition and understanding, \nbased on a series of theory developments or changes. \nWhile the initial system will only have neonatal infant-like \nskills, a developmental program, and an appropriate \nenvironment (e.g., see [34]), the resulting system, after \nextended developmental phases in which theory skills \nthemselves are acquired, should be able to learn new \ntheories and adapt its existing theories. \nIn this paper we explore the potential for theory \ngrounding in one particular domain, the domain of \nlanguage. We focus on language as opposed to other \ntheory domains (e.g., social understanding) for several \nPoster to be presented at the International Conference on Development and Learning (ICDL'02), MIT, \nSummer 2002. \nreasons. First, language appears fundamental to the \ndevelopment of social understanding (theory of mind). [1] \nhas found that earlier developing language abilities are \nrelated to later social understanding performance, but not \nvice versa. Second, language itself may be theoretical in its \nvery nature. The theory-theory indicates that childrens  \nconceptual development is theory formation and change, \nand that their semantic development is theory-dependent \n(p. 11, [17]). The theory-theory suggests we may acquire a \ntheory of language in much the same way that we acquire a \ntheory of mind. Third, an active, exploring theory-view of \nlanguage acquisition is compatible with some existing \ntheories of language acquisition ([14]; [23]; [24]). [24] \nviews language as just another problem space for children \nto explore. In word learning, children acquire a series of \nprinciples, heuristics that constrain the language search \nspace ([23]). From the multiple cues surrounding them in \nword learning contexts, children gradually cull more \nsophisticated heuristics for word learning. They implicitly \ntest their current theories, shift the weights of the cues, and \nsubsequently alter their word learning principles (p. 26, \n[23]). Fourth, language has been considered vital to the \nproperties of productivity and systematicity. These \nconcepts characterize a good deal of the linguistic \nflexibility we expect from symbol systems ([12]). \nProductivity refers to a system being able to encode \nindefinitely many propositions, and systematicity refers to \na system as being able to represent related propositions \n(e.g., a system representing aRb implies it can also \nrepresent bRa). Fifth, we are exploring the generality of \ntheory grounding. To a degree then, we are accepting the \ntenets of the theory-theory ([17]). We are positing that \ntheory acquisition is an important driving force behind \nvarious domain developments in children. From a \nmodeling and artificial intelligence view, we want to assess \nthe usefulness of this general framework. \nThe remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. First, \nwe elaborate on the idea of theory grounding, further \nconsidering aspects of theory of mind development, and \ntouching on relevant robotics literature. Second, we move \non to language, our target domain for constructing theory \ngrounded systems, and outline major developments that \noccur in word learning in infancy. Next, we consider \nexamples from language development that appear theory-\nlike, and targets for our approach. We also outline the \nbeginnings of our own research. Last, we end with \ndiscussions and conclusions. \n \n2. Theory Grounding \n \nClearly, skills with theories are not innate in the young \nchild. These skills involve a series of developmental \nphases, the interaction of environment and biological \nendowment, and successive growth (see also [11]). \nInitially, as a pre-linguistic young infant, a child starts to \nacquire social skills such as primary intersubjectivity, or \nthe basics of one-on-one reciprocal interactions with a \ncaregiver. Secondary intersubjectivity (or joint attention), \nwhere the child and adult involve an item or event (e.g., a \ntoy) in their interactions, starts shortly thereafter ([41]). \nThe representational skills or understandings of a young \ninfant of this age (e.g., 9 months) appear largely perceptual \n(although the area has controversy; see: [18]). It is not until \nabout 18 months, when words often start to be acquired at \na much faster rate (the naming explosion; [15]; [29]), \nand other developments such as pretend play (e.g., [10]) \noccur, that the child starts to represent situations other than \nthe immediate reality of a present situation. That is, the \nchild can [now] think of alternatives to reality (p. 168, \n[30]). It seems that prior to this point in development, the \nyoung child literally has not yet developed the mental \napparatus to enable this first step in theoretical \nunderstanding: an initial ability to reason explicitly about \nhypotheses. \nThe study of social understanding or theory of mind has \nshown us another vital step in the childs mental skills. In \nthe typical psychological developments from age three to \nage four, the young child starts to understand that what \npeople (including themselves) know is not necessarily \ncorrect. Sometimes people represent reality with their \nmental states, and other times people misrepresent reality \n([30]). This phenomenon was initially explored in the \ncontext of young childrens understanding of false-belief \n([43]). These experiments studied children of ages three to \nseven. They were told stories such as Maxi and the \nChocolate where Maxi first places some chocolate in the \nGREEN cupboard, and then unknown to Maxi, his mother \nplaces the chocolate in the BLUE cupboard. The \nexperimenters then ask the child a test question Where \nwill Maxi look for the chocolate? Children younger than \nfour nearly always indicated Maxi would look in the \nBLUE cupboard. Children four and older answer correctly \n(GREEN cupboard), starting to understand that Maxi has a \nfalse belief, incorrectly representing the present reality. At \nage four, the child can now distinguish between what a \nbelief is intended to represent (e.g., the location of the \nchocolate) versus what it actually represents (e.g., the \nempty GREEN cupboard). Prior to this, while a child can \nthink of alternatives to a present reality, they seem unable \nto hold in mind conflicting representations of the present \nreality ([30]). \nThese changes in the skills and knowledge of a child, \nfrom initial social skills (e.g., primary intersubjectivity), to \nthinking about alternatives to reality at two years of age, \nand to understanding that people can represent and \nmisrepresent reality at four years of age have been termed \nrepresentational change (e.g., [31]). These developments \nindicate a path towards a full-fledged concept of symbol \ngrounding, i.e., theory grounding. We continue to use the \nterm symbol grounding here because part of the skills that \nthe child is developing are surely symbolic skills. And it is \nthis developmental progression of skills that gives us \ninsight into how to ground symbols in a robotic system. \nSymbol usage is a combination of social and object-related \nskill that makes perhaps its first appearance in word \nlearning, and initial skills with representing alternative \nsituations. More robust skills in understanding that beliefs \ncan conflict with reality make their appearance at age four. \nSome progress has been made in robotic systems \ntowards these goals. Kismet ([3]) is a head robot and \nmodels infant caregiver interaction (e.g., primary \nintersubjectivity). The robot regulates intensity in human-\nrobot social interaction by providing facial cues to the \nhuman indicating its level of arousal (e.g., surprise vs. \ntiredness). Part of the goals of the Cog robot ([5]) include \nmodeling the development of theory of mind skills of a \nchild ([36]). Cog is an upper-torso humanoid robot on \nwhich various behaviors have been implemented. These \nbehaviors include the beginnings of an implementation of \njoint attention comprising finding faces, determining the \nlocation of eyes within a face, and saccading to center the \nface in the peripheral image ([37]). Learning methods were \nused to train saccade and foveal mappings. Infanoid is also \nan upper-torso humanoid robot and the project has goals \nincluding modeling the acquisition of intentionality or \nusing cause-effect associations as method-goal associations \n([27]). Infanoid also has the beginnings of an \nimplementation of joint attention. In this case, the robot \nfirst visually searches for a human face, saccades to the \nface, estimates the direction of gaze, and then searches for \na salient object in the direction of gaze. \n \n3. Word Learning in Language Development \n \nTheory grounding emphasizes ongoing development of \ntheory skills through sensori-motor interaction with the \nworld. In the language domain, sensory-motor interaction \nis an important facet of language development. A child \nuses her sensori-motor system to hear and produce \nlanguage and to interact with the social and physical world. \nIn this section, we sketch the development of word \nlearning in infants. We emphasize a particular theory of \nlanguage development, the emergentist coalition theory \n([23]). \nThe first words learned by children (e.g., first words are \nproduced at about 12 months; [13]) are rather different \nthan later words. Children learn these first words slowly \nand deliberately, the words may be context-bound, and \nthey learn words based on attentional and linguistic \ninformation, and to a lesser extent, social information. \nThese words appear less linguistic and more rote in their \nbasis in that it takes numerous experiences with the word \nand its referent for the child to learn ([20]; [21]). [22] used \na connectionist model to model this early word learning in \npart because it seems appropriate to characterize these \nlearning mechanisms as associative. [2] suggests that at \nthe start [of word learning], the word is not separate from \nthe episode in which it was first encountered, and it enters \nthe memory [of the child] as a virtual fusion of form and \ncontenta word-image representation (p. 25). The \nreason why these words are more rote and not separate \nfrom the initial learning episode (context-bound), appears \nto be that the infant has not yet integrated all of the \ninformational cues comprising words into the word \nlearning situation. In short, the child has not yet learned \nthat words are words, and is using more general learning \nmechanisms to acquire word-object (for example) \nassociations. \nThis is perhaps not surprising. Word learning, as a part \nof language learning, is a complex endeavor and certainly \nit takes the child some time to master the process. \nEmergentist coalition theory posits that children use a \nrange of attentional, linguistic, and social cues or \ninformation types in learning words. Attentional cues \ninvolve information comprising the earliest influences on \nword learning  such as perceptual salience, temporal \ncontiguity, and novelty (p. 18, [23]). Linguistic cues are \ncues from the language input itself, which help infants to \nfind the words in the speech stream and identify their part \nof speech (p. 20, [23]). For example, the difference \nbetween the mothers speech sounds and the sounds made \nby animals, the childs crib toy, and the beep of a \nmicrowave oven. In learning their first words, children \nmake primary use of attentional and linguistic cues. For \nexample, objects that are brightly colored and moving may \nbe perceptually salient to a child, and draw her attention. A \ncaregiver uttering the word ball when she is playing with \nan object that has captured her attention may start the \nyoung infant on the path to learning that word. \nWhile social cues such as eye gaze and pointing start to \nbe recognized earlier outside of the language context, it \ntakes the child time to incorporate this social information \ninto word learning. For example, while a nine-month-old \ncan perceptually recognize aspects of the eye-gaze of an \nadult ([6]), they dont start to cognitively utilize adult eye-\ngaze as a social cue in word learning until about 12 months \nof age ([23]). This difference between availability and \nutilization of a stimulus cue (e.g., eye gaze) typifies the \nprogressive utilization of cue information proposed by the \nemergentist coalition theory. Attentional, linguistic, and \nsocial cues are posited as available to the child from the \nstart of word learning but children progressively utilize the \ncues in their language acquisition, over the course of \ndevelopment. It is interesting to note that even after a child \nhas come to utilize social cues such as eye gaze and \npointing, much of their word learning is still based on their \nown attentional interests as opposed to anothers focus \n(e.g., a caregiver: [2]; [40]; [39]). That is, infants often \nlearn what they care about ([2]). \nEmergentist coalition theory suggests that the child uses \nguided distributional learning to incorporate additional \nstimulus cues into their word learning. For example \nchildren may come to realize, pragmatically, that eye gaze \nis a good indicator of the consistent mapping [of words to \nobjects], and they may come to follow it, or make use of it \nin directing attention (p. 25, [23]). Children are viewed as \nevaluating and weighing the kinds of cues that can be used \nto best inform the word learning process. The problem \nbeing solved by the infant is that of actively integrating and \nmaking sense of the flow of attentional, social, and \nlinguistic information. The social cue of eye gaze comes to \nbe selected as an integral piece of information, assisting in \nmaking the word-learning situation coherent. Eye-gaze \ncomes to indicate the referent of a word, precisely \nbecause of its co-occurrence with speech utterances. \nStarting at 19 to 21 months, when a child has 30 to 100 \nwords in their productive vocabulary, a marked transition \noccurs in the childs word learningthe vocabulary spurt \nor naming explosion ([13]). It is at this time that children \ntypically start learning words far more rapidly than \nbeforein a fast mapping manner, where they may need \nonly one learning experience with a word to learn its basics \n([7]). Children at this age can now think of alternatives to \nreality ([30]), a vital mental basis on which to start to \nformulate explicit hypotheses. It seems that what the child \nis doing with their first fragile, tentative, and imprecise \nwords is to grope to find the associations that connect the \ndifferent circumstances in which words are experienced \n(p. 25, [2]) and piece together the word-puzzle itself at a \nhigher level. That is, this vocabulary spurt appears to \nindicate a conceptual insight that objects have names \n([16]). Presumably this insight, or theoretical leap, is based \non the coherent integration of the complete set of \nattentional, linguistic, and social cues in word learning. \n \n4. A Theory Grounded Theory of Language \n \nWe are viewing the child as learning various theories \nabout the world, including a theory of language. As a \nnormal linguistic environment has other children and \nadults speaking, the language learning child will be faced \nwith forming a theory of language that includes the various \nelements of the language being spoken, including concepts \nrelating to words. \nThe challenge facing a theory grounded theory of \nlanguage is to construct a robotic model that gradually \nacquires language skills based on interaction with a \nlanguage environment. For  example, we might start with a \nrobotic system that has already achieved skills of basic \nsocial interaction approximating primary and secondary \nintersubjectivity (e.g., [3]; [5]; [27]). Based on these social \nskills and structures, we would need to acquire initial \nwords based on general (associative) learning \nmechanismsin accord with the emergentist coalition \ntheory. Of course, these early words should not be \npreprogrammed linguistic entities for the robotic model. At \n10 to 12 months of age, a young infant has presumably not \nyet learned what words are, and is using general learning \nmechanisms to acquire the data upon which the world can \nbe further organized. It is just that a basic aspect of the \nlanguage environment is comprised of units of speech \n(words) that designate (refer to) objects, events, emotions, \nactions etc. in the environment. As the young child uses \ngeneral learning mechanisms to learn various features of \nthe environment, including context-bound word-image \nrepresentations, he will gradually start to make use of more \nand more information comprising the word learning \nsituation, such as the social cues of eye gaze and pointing. \nIn fact, it likely takes some time for the child to learn that \nspeech sounds themselves are special in the word-learning \ncontext, and that linguistically it is not just any sound that \nis associated with a referent object, event or action (e.g., \nExperiments 10-12, [23]). A task facing the theory \nbuilding skills of the child is exactly the problem of \nseparating the language input (e.g., the words) from the \nrest of what is being learned. The naming explosion is an \nexcellent example of the child solving this problem. When \nthe child starts to fast map words ([7]), it seems clear that \nthey have formed a cornerstone of their theory of language. \nThey have figured out that, in fact, objects have names in \nthe environment, and that an important linguistic element is \nthat of a word. \n[35] and [38] have constructed robotic models that start \nto learn words. These models face the problem of using \ngeneral learning methods to associate speech sounds and \nobjects, using robotic sensori-motor systems. [35] used \nspeech segmentation to generate phoneme-based \nrepresentations for the words uttered by a human when an \nobject was viewed by the camera sensor of the robot. \nIndividual objects are viewed by a camera, and 15 2D \nviews of the object are obtained. Each view is reduced to a \nshape histogram comprised of distance and angle points for \npairs of boundary pixels, and a color histogram. The goal \nof this model is to discover the words (phoneme \nsequences) that predict the presence of objects (shape and \ncolor representations). Word-object associations were \nconstructed by an information theoretic measure. The \nvisual and acoustic representations used by [38] were \nsimilar to those used by [35], and these authors pretrained \nthe speech system with a large vocabulary of common \ndialog words and used an associative memory, based on \nreinforcement learning, to store relations between object \nviews and words. \nMissing from both of these above models is a method of \nacquiring the concept of a word itself. That is, while these \nmodels learn words using general learning mechanisms, \nthey assume some kind of word learning rather than \ndeveloping or learning the fact that words are a separate \nkind of category of elements to be learned about in the \nenvironment. It is our research goal to build robotic \nmodels that develop word-learning capacities in a theory \ngrounded manner. It is our goal to have a theory grounded \nrobotic model eventually come to form its own concept of \nwords and names. \nOur first step towards a theory grounded concept of \nwords is to construct a model that has both acoustic and \nvisual inputs and learns various kinds of associations \nbetween sights and sounds. We assume that for the young \ninfant, just starting to learn words, and without having \nintegrated the social cues of eye gaze and pointing, and \nperhaps even speech per se, into a word-learning \nsituation, they will learn various associations between \nsights and sounds in a similar manner. For example, a child \nmay learn that the sound apple is associated with a \nroughly circular red object because her father utters the \nword apple when she is playing with the fruit. Using \nsimilar learning mechanisms, the child may also learn that \nthe sound of an opening door predicts someone coming \nthrough the door. Correlated with the sight-sound \nassociations that will eventually be learned to be words are \nalso other kinds of inputsthe sounds themselves are \nuniquely speech sounds, and there will likely be various \nsocial cues: the presence of the face of the caregiver, eye \ngaze, and perhaps facial, hand, and other body gestures. \nWe are constructing a model designed to learn various \nsound-object associations from acoustic-visual input. \nInitially avoiding real-time issues, we are first running \noffline simulations using prerecorded video. Later, we will \nmove to a robotic platform. The model will have a \ndevelopmental algorithm to autonomously categorize the \nkinds of associations learned, and feed that category \nlearning back into the learning of the associations. We are \nproposing that part of what happens in the childs learning \nof the category of words is that they are categorizing \nnaming itself as different from other learning situations. \nAfter all, the naming situation is strongly correlated with \ncues of speech, and various social cues, while other kinds \nof learning situations are less strongly correlated with \nspeech and social cues. \n \n5. Discussion and Conclusions \n \nThe challenge is as posed by [26]: to construct \nadaptive systems that can perform (p. 356). In the present \ncontext, we are working towards creating systems that are \nnot initially programmed with concepts, but that instead \ndevelop theories of these concepts based on data acquired \nby a sensori-motor system. Our goal is to develop a theory \ngrounded theory of language, and we are starting work on \ndevelopmental algorithms related to word learning. While \nsome prior research ([35]; [38]) has modeled word \nlearning using general learning mechanisms and sensori-\nmotor systems, these systems do not yet learn a concept of \nwords. For example, they do not learn distinctions between \nword learning and other kinds of learning being carried \nout, and explore the consequences of the differences \nbetween words and other kinds of actions and learning. \nFor example, words are different because they have \ncommunicative function between social individuals. \nWe believe a theory grounded approach to cognitive \nrobotics has value for reasons analogous to why theory of \nmind has value in developmental psychology. In \npsychology, its a difficult problem to evaluate just exactly \nwhat a mind is. It appears easier to place objective \ncriteria on having a theory of mind (e.g., false-belief). In \ncognitive robotics, while grounding symbols is an \nimportant and necessary step, many different systems can \nhave grounded symbols. A next step, and one we believe \nhas objective criteria for success, is for us to enable our \nrobotic systems to develop theories of symbols. \n \n6.

A positive semantic ori-\nentation implies desirability (e.g., “honest”, “intrepid”) and a negative semantic orientation\nimplies undesirability (e.g., “disturbing”, “superfluous”). This paper introduces a simple algo-\nrithm for unsupervised learning of semantic orientation from extremely large corpora. The\nmethod involves issuing queries to a Web search engine and using pointwise mutual informa-\ntion to analyse the results. The algorithm is empirically evaluated using a training corpus of\napproximately one hundred billion words — the subset of the Web that is indexed by the cho-\nsen search engine. Tested with 3,596 words (1,614 positive and 1,982 negative), the algorithm\nattains an accuracy of 80%. The 3,596 test words include adjectives, adverbs, nouns, and\nverbs. The accuracy is comparable with the results achieved by Hatzivassiloglou and McKe-\nown (1997), using a complex four-stage supervised learning algorithm that is restricted to\ndetermining the semantic orientation of adjectives.\n1. Semantic Orientation from Association\nTurney and Littman 1\nIntroduction\nMany words communicate the speaker's evaluation of the item that is under discussion as desir-\nable or undesirable. This evaluative character a word is called its semantic orientation. A word\nwith a positive semantic orientation conveys the evaluation that the item is desirable (e.g.,\n“beautiful”) and a negative orientation conveys the evaluation that the item is undesirable (e.g.,\n“absurd”).\nThis paper presents a general strategy for inferring semantic orientation from semantic asso-\nciation. Section 1 gives two examples of this strategy, one based on mutual information (Church\n& Hanks, 1989) and the other based on Latent Semantic Analysis (Landauer and Dumais, 1997). \nRelated work is examined in Section 2. Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) have devel-\noped a supervised learning algorithm that learns semantic orientation from linguistic constraints\non the use of adjectives in conjunctions. \nThe experimental results are presented in Section 3. The algorithms are evaluated using\n3,596 words (1,614 positive and 1,982 negative) taken from the General Inquirer lexicon (Stone\net al., 1966). These words include adjectives, adverbs, nouns, and verbs. An accuracy of 80% is\nattained, using an unlabeled training corpus of approximately one hundred billion words. The\ninterpretation of the experimental results is given in Section 4.\nSection 5 lists some potential applications of the algorithms, such as filtering “flames” (abu-\nsive messages) for newsgroups (Spertus, 1997) and tracking opinions in on-line discussions\n(Tong, 2001). The paper concludes with some speculation about possible extensions of this\napproach to other tasks.\n1. Semantic Orientation from Association\nThe general strategy in this paper is to infer semantic orientation from semantic association.\nSeven positive words (good, nice, excellent, positive, fortunate, correct, and superior) and seven\nnegative words (bad, nasty, poor, negative, unfortunate, wrong, and inferior) are used as para-\ndigms of positive and negative semantic orientation. The semantic orientation of a given word is\ncalculated from the strength of its association with the seven positive words, minus the strength\nof its association with the seven negative words. These fourteen words were chosen using intu-\nition. They are based on opposing pairs (good/bad, nice/nasty, excellent/poor, etc.).\nIt could be argued that this is a supervised learning algorithm with fourteen labeled training\nexamples and millions or billions of unlabeled training examples. However, it seems more\nappropriate to say that the paradigm words are defining semantic orientation, rather than training\nthe algorithm. \nThis general strategy is called SO-A (Semantic Orientation from Association). Selecting par-\nticular measures of word association results in particular instances of the strategy. This paper\nexamines SO-PMI-IR (Semantic Orientation from Pointwise Mutual Information and Informa-\ntion Retrieval) and SO-LSA (Semantic Orientation from Latent Semantic Analysis).\n1.1 Semantic Orientation from PMI-IR\nPMI-IR (Turney, 2001) uses Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) to calculate the strength of the\nsemantic association between words (Church & Hanks, 1989). Word co-occurrence statistics are\nobtained using Information Retrieval (IR). PMI-IR has been empirically evaluated using 80 syn-\nonym test questions from the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), obtaining a score\nof 74% (Turney, 2001). For comparison, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) attains a score of 64%\n1. Semantic Orientation from Association\n2 ERB-1094, Unsupervised Learning of Semantic Orientation\non the same 80 TOEFL questions (Landauer & Dumais, 1997). \nThe Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) between two words,  and , is defined\nas follows (Church & Hanks, 1989):\n(1)\nHere,  is the probability that  and  co-occur. If the words are\nstatistically independent, the probability that they co-occur is given by the product\n. The ratio between  and  is a mea-\nsure of the degree of statistical dependence between the words. The log of the ratio is the amount\nof information that we acquire about the presence of one word when we observe the other. \nThe semantic orientation of a word, , is calculated by SO-PMI-IR as follows:\n(2)\nIn this equation,  represents the seven positive words (good, nice, excel-\nlent, positive, fortunate, correct, and superior) and  represents the seven\nnegative words (bad, nasty, poor, negative, unfortunate, wrong, and inferior). \nPMI-IR estimates PMI by issuing queries to a search engine (hence the IR in PMI-IR) and\nnoting the number of hits (matching documents). The following experiments use the AltaVista\nAdvanced Search engine1, which indexes approximately 350 million Web pages (counting only\nthose pages that are in English). Given a (conservative) estimate of 300 words per Web page, this\nrepresents a corpus of at least one hundred billion words.\nAltaVista was chosen because it has a NEAR operator. The AltaVista NEAR operator con-\nstrains the search to documents that contain the words within ten words of one another, in either\norder. Previous work has shown that NEAR performs better than AND when measuring the\nstrength of semantic association between words (Turney, 2001).\nLet  be the number of hits returned, given the query . The following equa-\ntion can be derived from equations (1) and (2) with some minor algebraic manipulation, if co-\noccurrence is interpreted as NEAR:\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\nThus calculating the semantic orientation of a word requires four queries to AltaVista. Since\n and  only need to be calculated once, the experiments required an\naverage of only two queries per word. To avoid division by zero, 0.01 was added to the number\nof hits.2\nA word, , is classified as having a positive semantic orientation when\n is positive and a negative orientation when  is negative.\nThe magnitude of  can be considered as the strength of the semantic orienta-\n1. See http://www.altavista.com/sites/search/adv.\n2. The number 0.01 was arbitrarily chosen. This is a form of Laplace smoothing.\nword1 word2\nPMI word1 word2,( ) log2\np word1 & word2( )\np word1( ) p word2( )\n------------------------------------------------\n\u0000 \u0001\n\u0002 \u0003\n=\np word1 & word2( ) word1 word2\np word1( ) p word2( ) p word1 & word2( ) p word1( ) p word2( )\nword\nSO-PMI-IR word( ) PMI word positive   paradigms{ },( )=\nPMI word negative  paradigms{ },( )–\npositive  paradigms{ }\nnegative  paradigms{ }\nhits query( ) query\nSO-PMI-IR word( ) log2\nhits word   NEAR  p_query( ) hits n_query( )\nhits word   NEAR  n_query( ) hits p_query( )-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u0000 \u0001\n\u0002 \u0003\n=\np_query good  OR  nice  OR … OR  superior( )=\nn_query bad  OR  nasty  OR … OR  inferior( )=\nhits n_query( ) hits p_query( )\nword\nSO-PMI-IR word( ) SO-PMI-IR word( )\nSO-PMI-IR word( )\n2. Related Work\nTurney and Littman 3\ntion.\n1.2 Semantic Orientation from LSA\nSO-LSA applies Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) to calculate the strength of the semantic asso-\nciation between words (Landauer and Dumais, 1997). LSA uses the Singular Value Decomposi-\ntion (SVD) to analyze the statistical relationships among words in a corpus. \nThe first step is to use the text to construct a matrix A, in which the row vectors represent\nwords and the column vectors represent chunks of text (e.g., sentences, paragraphs, documents).\nEach cell represents the weight of the corresponding word in the corresponding chunk of text.\nThe weight is typically the TF.IDF score (Term Frequency times Inverse Document Frequency)\nfor the word in the chunk. (TF.IDF is a standard tool in Information Retrieval.) \nThe next step is to apply SVD to A, to decompose A into a product of three matrices UΣVT,\nwhere U and V are in column orthonormal form (i.e., the columns are orthogonal and have unit\nlength) and S is a diagonal matrix of singular values (hence SVD). If A is of rank r, then Σ is\nalso of rank r. Let Σk, where k < r, be the matrix produced by removing from Σ the r - k columns\nand rows with the smallest singular values, and let Uk and Vk be the matrices produced by\nremoving the corresponding columns from U and V. The matrix UkΣkVkT is the matrix of rank k\nthat best approximates the original matrix A, in the sense that it minimizes the sum of the\nsquares of the approximation errors. We may think of this matrix UkΣkVkT as a “smoothed” or\n“compressed” version of the original matrix A.\nSVD may be viewed as a form of principal components analysis. LSA works by measuring\nthe similarity of words using this compressed matrix, instead of the original matrix. The similar-\nity of two words, , is measured by the cosine of the angle between their cor-\nresponding compressed row vectors.\nThe semantic orientation of a word, , is calculated by SO-LSA as follows:\n(6)\n(7)\nAs with SO-PMI-IR, a word, word, is classified as having a positive semantic orientation when\n is positive and a negative orientation when  is negative. The\nmagnitude of  represents the strength of the semantic orientation.\n2. Related Work\nThis work is most closely related to Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown's (1997) work on predicting\nthe semantic orientation of adjectives. They note that there are linguistic constraints on the\nsemantic orientations of adjectives in conjunctions. As an example, they present the following\nthree sentences:\n1. The tax proposal was simple and well-received by the public.\n2. The tax proposal was simplistic but well-received by the public.\n3. (*) The tax proposal  was simplistic and well-received by the public.\nThe third sentence is incorrect, because we use “and” with adjectives that have the same seman-\nLSA word1 word2,( )\nword\nSO-LSA-IR word( ) LSA word positive  paradigms{ },( )=\nLSA word negative  paradigms{ },( )–\nLSA word good,( ) … LSA word superior,( )+ +[ ]=\nLSA word bad,( ) … LSA word inferior,( )+ +[ ]–\nSO-LSA word( ) SO-LSA word( )\nSO-LSA word( )\n2. Related Work\n4 ERB-1094, Unsupervised Learning of Semantic Orientation\ntic orientation (“simple” and “well-received” are both positive), but we use “but” with adjectives\nthat have different semantic orientations (“simplistic” is negative). \nHatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) use a four-step supervised learning algorithm to infer\nthe semantic orientation of adjectives from constraints on conjunctions:\n1. All conjunctions of adjectives are extracted from the given corpus.\n2. A supervised learning algorithm combines multiple sources of evidence to label pairs of\nadjectives as having the same semantic orientation or different semantic orientations.\nThe result is a graph where the nodes are adjectives and links indicate sameness or dif-\nference of semantic orientation. \n3. A clustering algorithm processes the graph structure to produce two subsets of adjec-\ntives, such that links across the two subsets are mainly different-orientation links, and\nlinks inside a subset are mainly same-orientation links.\n4. Since it is known that positive adjectives tend to be used more frequently than negative\nadjectives, the cluster with the higher average frequency is classified as having positive\nsemantic orientation.\nFor brevity, we will call this the HM algorithm.\nLike SO-PMI-IR and SO-LSA, HM can produce a real-valued number that indicates both the\ndirection (positive or negative) and the strength of the semantic orientation. The clustering algo-\nrithm (step 3 above) can produce a “goodness-of-fit” measure that indicates how well an adjec-\ntive fits in its assigned cluster. \nHatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) used a corpus of 21 million words and evaluated HM\nwith 1,336 manually-labeled adjectives (657 positive and 679 negative). Their results are given\nin Table 1.3 HM classifies adjectives with accuracies ranging from 78% to 92%, depending on\nthe Alpha parameter, described next. \nFor a given adjective, Alpha is a measure of the confidence that the adjective will be cor-\nrectly classified by HM, given the amount of data about the adjective that is available in the cor-\npus. A threshold on Alpha is used to partition the 1,336 labeled adjectives into training and\ntesting sets. For example, the first row in the table shows the accuracy when the training set is\n606 adjectives with Alpha equal 1 and the testing set is 730 adjectives with Alpha greater than or\nequal to 2. As expected, the accuracy rises as the more difficult adjectives (adjectives with low\nAlpha) are moved from the testing set into the training set.\nThis algorithm is able to achieve good accuracy levels, but it has some limitations. In con-\ntrast with learning semantic orientation from semantic association,  HM is restricted to adjec-\ntives, it requires labeled adjectives as training data, and the four-step process is difficult to\nimplement and to analyze theoretically.\n3. This table is derived from Table 3 in Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997).\nTable 1: The accuracy of HM with a 21 million-word corpus.\nAlpha threshold Accuracy Size of test set Percent of “full” test set\n2 78.08% 730 100.0%\n3 82.56% 516 70.7%\n4 87.26% 369 50.5%\n5 92.37% 236 32.3%\n3. Experiments\nTurney and Littman 5\n3. Experiments\nThe following experiments use the General Inquirer lexicon (Stone et al., 1966) as a benchmark\nto evaluate the learning algorithms.4 This lexicon has 182 categories of word tags and 11,788\nwords. The words tagged “Positiv” (1,915 words) and “Negativ” (2,291 words) have (respec-\ntively) positive and negative semantic orientations. Words with multiple senses may have multi-\nple entries in the lexicon. The list of 3,596 words (1,614 positive and 1,982 negative) used in the\nsubsequent experiments was generated by reducing multiple-entry words to single entries.\nTable 2 lists some examples.\n3.1 Experiments with SO-PMI-IR\nTable 3 shows the accuracy of SO-PMI-IR with a training corpus of 350 million Web pages (at\nleast one hundred billion words). These are the English Web pages that are indexed by AltaVista.\nIn this table, strength of the semantic orientation was used as a measure of confidence that the\nword will be correctly classified. Test words were sorted in descending order of the absolute\nvalue of their semantic orientation and the top ranked words (the highest confidence words) were\nthen classified. For example, the second row in Table 3 shows the accuracy when the top 75%\nwere classified and the bottom 25% (with lowest confidence) were ignored. .\nAlthough Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown’s (1997) experiment is different in several ways\nfrom this experiment (different algorithms, different test words, different corpora), Tables 1 and\n3 show very similar results. With 100% of the test set words, HM has an accuracy of 78% and\nSO-PMI-IR has an accuracy of 80%. With 50% of the (higher confidence) test set words, the cor-\nresponding accuracies are 87% and 90%.\nTable 4 shows the accuracy with 7 million Web pages (at least two billion words). This\nreduced corpus was produced by adding “AND host:.ca” to every query, which restricts the\nsearch results to the Web pages in the Internet domain “ca” (Canada). \nAlthough the corpus in Table 4 is only 2% of the size of the corpus in Table 3, the accuracy\n4.

Experiments\n6 ERB-1094, Unsupervised Learning of Semantic Orientation\ndrops only slightly, less than 3%. Interestingly, the gap between Table 1 (HM) and Table 4 is\nvery small.\nTable 5 shows the accuracy of SO-PMI-IR with a ten-million word corpus, the TASA-ALL\ncorpus that has been used to train LSA.5 This corpus is 0.5% of the size of the corpus in Table 4,\nand there is now a large drop in accuracy. The accuracy also does not increase smoothly as we\ndecrease the percentage of the test set that is classified, which shows that the magnitude of the\nsemantic orientation is no longer a good indicator of the confidence in the classification of a\nword.6 \nThe TASA-ALL corpus is not indexed by AltaVista. The above results were generated by\nemulating AltaVista on a local copy of the TASA-ALL corpus.\n3.2 Experiments with SO-LSA\nTable 6 shows the accuracy of SO-LSA with a 37,651 document corpus (approximately ten mil-\nlion words). This experiment used the online demonstration of LSA7 with the TASA-ALL cor-\npus. The corpus was used to generate a matrix A with 92,409 rows (words) and 37,651 columns\n(chunks of text) and SVD reduced the matrix to 300 dimensions. In the online demonstration,\nthis is called the “General Reading up to 1st year college (300 factors)” topic space.\nThe results in Table 6 can be directly compared with the results in Table 5, since they are\nbased on the same corpus. SO-PMI-IR and SO-LSA have approximately the same accuracy when\nevaluated on the full test set, but SO-LSA rapidly pulls ahead as we decrease the percentage of\nthe test set that is classified. It appears that the magnitude of SO is a better indicator of confi-\ndence for SO-LSA than for SO-PMI-IR, at least when the corpus is relatively small.\nTable 4: The accuracy of SO-PMI-IR with a two-billion word corpus. \nPercent of full test set Size of test set Accuracy\n100% 3596 77.47%\n75% 2697 83.98%\n50% 1798 87.76%\n25% 899 89.43%\n5.

It might be possible to improve these results by optimizing the Laplace smoothing factor (0.01), but we have not yet\ntried this.\n7. See http://lsa.colorado.edu/.\n4. Discussion of Results\nTurney and Littman 7\n4. Discussion of Results\nThe interpretation of the results is complicated by the use of different test words (in Section 2\nversus Section 3) and different corpora. Unfortunately, Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown’s (1997)\nset of 1,336 manually-labeled adjectives was not available for testing SO-PMI-IR and SO-LSA.\nAlso, LSA has not yet been scaled up to corpora of the sizes that are available for PMI-IR, so we\nwere unable to evaluate SO-LSA on the larger corpora that were used to evaluate SO-PMI-IR (in\nTables 3 and 4). \nWith these caveats in mind, the experiments suggest that the SO-PMI-IR can reach the same\nlevel of accuracy as HM, given a sufficiently large corpus. The results also hint that SO-LSA is\nable to use data more efficiently than SO-PMI-IR, and SO-LSA might surpass the 80% accuracy\nattained by SO-PMI-IR, given a corpus of comparable size.\nHM is restricted to adjectives, it requires labeled training data, and it is complex. SO-PMI-IR\nand SO-LSA overcome these three limitations, but they appear to require larger corpora to\nachieve good accuracy levels.\n5. Applications\nThe motivation of Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) was to use semantic orientation as a\ncomponent in a larger system, to automatically identify antonyms and distinguish near syn-\nonyms. Both synonyms and antonyms typically have strong semantic associations, but synonyms\ngenerally have the same semantic orientation, whereas antonyms have opposite orientations.\nAnother potential application is filtering “flames” for newsgroups (Spertus, 1997). There\ncould be a threshold, such that a newsgroup message is held for verification by the human mod-\nerator when the semantic orientation of a word drops below the threshold.\nTong (2001) presents a system for generating sentiment timelines. This system tracks online\ndiscussions about movies and displays a plot of the number of positive sentiment and negative\nsentiment messages over time. Messages are classified by looking for specific phrases that indi-\ncate the sentiment of the author towards the movie. Tong’s (2001) system could benefit from the\nuse of a learning algorithm, instead of (or in addition to) a hand-built lexicon. Advertisers could\ntrack advertising campaigns, politicians could track public opinion, reporters could track public\nresponse to current events, and stock traders could track financial opinions.\nA related application is the analysis of survey responses to open ended questions. Commer-\ncial tools for this task include TextSmart8 (by SPSS) and Verbatim Blaster9 (by StatPac). These\ntools can be used to plot word frequencies or cluster responses into categories, but they do not\ncurrently analyze semantic orientation.\nTable 6: The accuracy of SO-LSA with a ten-million word corpus.\nPercent of full test set Size of test set Accuracy\n100% 3596 65.24%\n75% 2697 71.04%\n50% 1798 75.36%\n25% 899 81.65%\n8.

Applications\n8 ERB-1094, Unsupervised Learning of Semantic Orientation\nWe are currently experimenting with the use of semantic orientation to classify reviews (e.g.,\nmovie reviews, automobile reviews, travel reviews). The average semantic orientation of the\nwords in a review may be an indicator of whether the review is positive or negative. Table 7\nshows the average semantic orientation of sentences selected from reviews of banks, from the\nEpinions site.10 Five of these six randomly selected sentences are classified correctly.\nIn Table 7, for each sentence, the word with the strongest semantic orientation has been\nmarked in bold. These bold words dominate the average and largely determine the orientation of\nthe sentence as a whole. In the sentence that is misclassified as positive, the system is misled by\nthe sarcastic tone. The negative orientations of “stranger’s” and “sweaty” were not enough to\ncounter the strong positive orientation of “warm”.\nAnother application is in an automated chat system (a chatbot), to help decide whether a pos-\nitive or negative response is most appropriate. Characters in software games would appear more\nrealistic if they responded to semantic orientation.\nConclusion\nThis paper has presented a general strategy for learning semantic orientation from semantic asso-\nciation, SO-A. Two instances of this strategy have been empirically evaluated, SO-PMI-IR and\nSO-LSA. The accuracy of SO-PMI-IR is comparable to the accuracy of HM, the algorithm of\nHatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997). SO-PMI-IR requires a large corpus, but it is simple,\neasy to implement, unsupervised, and it is not restricted to adjectives.\nIn the future, corpora of a hundred billion words will be common and the average desktop\ncomputer will be able to process them easily. Today, we can indirectly work with corpora of this\nsize through Web search engines, as we have done in this paper. With a little bit of creativity, a\nWeb search engine can tell us a lot about language use.\nMore specifically, the ideas in SO-A can likely be extended to many other semantic aspects\nTable 7: The average semantic orientation of some sample sentences from reviews of banks. \nPositive Reviews Average SO\n1.

Introduction \n \nExperimentally, tremendous progress has been made in neuroscience over the last several \ndecades (see Sakurai, 1999; Srinivasan et al, 1999). Tens of thousands of experiments \nhave been performed and even more papers were written. Theoretically, numerous \nversions of quantum and non-quantum consciousness theories have been proposed over \nthe recent years (e.g., Beck and Eccles, 1992; Crick, 1994; Donald, 1990; Edelman, 1989; \nHameroff and Penrose, 1996; LeDoux, 2002; Penrose, 1989 & 1994; Stapp, 1993; \nWalker, 2000). But, at this stage almost all are speculative and none is commonly \naccepted, although progress has also been made (see Goguen, 2002). Philosophically, the \nage-old debate about consciousness has intensified like a raging fire (e.g., Chalmers, \n1996; Churchland, 1993; Freeman, 2001; Searle, 1992). However, despite all these \nefforts, what is and causes consciousness remains a deep mystery (see Goguen, 2002). In \nthis paper, we propose a novel theory of consciousness with the hope that it would shed \nsome light on these issues. \n \nSpin is a very unique quantum mechanical concept with its own mystery, being often said \nto have no classical counterpart (see Tomonaga, 1997). Unlike mass and charge that enter \na dynamic equation as arbitrary parameters, spin reveals itself through the structure of the \nrelativistic quantum equation for fermions (Dirac, 1928). Thus, it is deeply connected to \nthe microscopic structure of spacetime. Further, because spin uniquely determines the \nstatistical properties of fermions and bosons (Pauli, 1940) – two classes of all known \nelementary particles, it may be said that spin is “protopsychic” thus makes a particle \n“conscious” about what quantum statistical rules to follow in a many -body system. \nIndeed, modern physics leads us right down to the microscopic domain of spacetime \nwhere many models of elementary particles and even space-time itself are built with \nspinors (Budinich, 2001; Penrose, 1960 & 1967) that were first used by Pauli (1927) and \nDirac (1928) to describe an electron of spin ½. Therefore, we strongly believe that Nature \nhas utilized quantum mechanical spin in constructing a conscious biological mind. \n \nIndeed, proton nuclear spin ½ is the most abundant unpaired nuclear spin to be found in \nneural membranes and proteins. Nothing else even comes close. Both magnetic resonance \nimaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI) are based on the abundance of proton nuclear \nspin in human body. Neural membranes play vital roles in the normal functions of a \nconscious brain. They transmit neural signals through propagating action potentials \nformed by the collective actions of voltage-regulated ion channels on the membranes. \nThey maintain a delicate environment for the proper functions of neural receptors and \nserve as barriers, carriers and filters for the proper metabolic life of a neuron. Their major \nmolecular components are phospholipids, proteins and cholesterols. Each phospholipid \nmolecule contains on its lipid chains a cluster of more than 60 nuclear spin ½, one in each \nhydrogen atom attached to the chain.  Neural proteins include membrane proteins such as \nion channels and neural transmitter receptors, structural proteins such as microtubules \ninside the dendrites, and many enzymes such as ATP-ase and nitric oxide (NO) synthase. \nAll these proteins play respectively very important roles in normal neural functions. Each \nof them contains a larger cluster of proton spin ½ intra-molecularly coupled as a network \nof spins. \n 3 \nVery importantly, we believe that the mechanism of anesthetic action is closely related to \nthe inner workings of consciousness. But how general anesthetics work is itself a 150-\nyear old mystery (see Cantor, 1997; Hu and Wu, 2001; Koubi, 2000). Besides \nunconsciousness, general anesthesia is marked by the overall depressed cerebral \nmetabolic functions and accompanied sometimes by hypoxia and acidosis (see Berthoud \nand Reilly, 1992; Fiset et al, 1999; Hempel et al, 1975). As will be discussed in more \ndetails later, we have already proposed within the framework of conventional \nneuroscience that anesthetic perturbations of oxygen pathways in both neural membranes \nand proteins are possibly involved in general anesthesia (Hu and Wu, 2001). \n \nOxygen molecule (O2) contains two unpaired valence electrons thus is strongly \nparamagnetic and at the same time chemically reactive as a bi-radical. It is capable of \nproducing a large fluctuating magnetic field along its diffusing pathway thus serves as a \nnatural contrast agent in MRI (see Morris, 1986). The existence of unpaired electrons in \nstable molecules is very rare indeed. O2 is the only paramagnetic molecule to be found in \nlarge quantities in the brain besides certain metal elements found in proteins. In addition, \nO2 is an essential component for energy production in the central nervous system. One of \nthe most immediate purposes of our respiratory and circulatory systems is to deliver O2 to \nthe brain (see Magistretti et al, 2002). \n \nO2 and NO, the latter being a unstable free radical with one unpaired electronic spin and a \nrecently discovered small neural transmitter, are well known in spin chemistry - a field \nfocused on the study of free-radical mediated chemical reactions where very small \nmagnetic energies can change non-equilibrium spin conversion process (e.g., Hayashi, \n2002; Nagakura, 1998). Thus O2 and NO may serve as “spin -catalysts” in consciousness -\nrelated neural biochemical reactions such as those dual path reactions initiated/driven by \nfree radicals (e.g., Minaev, 1996). \n \n \nII. Nature of Spin \n \nAs already mentioned above, spin is deeply connected to the microscopic structure of \nspacetime as reflected by the Dirac equation for fermions (Dirac, 1928). Indeed, Penrose \n(1960 & 1967) had considered early on that spin might be more fundamental than \nspacetime and invented spinor and twistor algebras for a combinatorial description of \nspacetime geometry. Bohm and Hiley (1984) generalized the twistor idea to Clifford \nalgebra as a possible basis for describing Bohm’s implicit order. Recently various spin \nfoams have been formulated as extensions to Penrose (1960)’s spin networks for the \npurpose of constructing a consistent theory of quantum gravity (e.g., Baez, 1998; Smolin, \n2001). According to Baez (1998), spin networks provide a language for describing the \nquantum geometry of space and spin foams attempt to extend this language to describe \nthe quantum geometry of spacetime. Thus, in the spin network picture, the seemingly \ncontinuous space is actually made up of building blocks that are the nodes and edges of \nthe spin network (Smolin, 2001). In the spin foam picture, the quantum transitions of spin \nnetworks represent the time evolution of said spin networks (Smolin, 2001). It is hoped \nthat fermionic matter can be incorporated as the vibrations/excitations of the spin \n 4 \nnetworks by adding a new set of mathematical representations corresponding to the \nfermionic matter field (Crane, 2000; Mikovie, 2002). \n \nMany others have also study the nature of spin from both classical and quantum- \nmechanical perspectives. For example, Newman (2002) showed that spin might have a \nclassical geometric origin. By treating the real Maxwell Field and real linearized Einstein \nequations as being embedded in complex Minkowski space, he was able to interpret spin-\nangular momentum as arising from a charge and “mass monopole” source moving along \na complex world line (Newman, 2002). Galiautdinov (2002) has considered a theory of \nspacetime quanta and suggested that spin might manifest the atomic structure of \nspacetime. Finkelstein (2002) is proposing that spin derives from a swap – a projective \npermutation operator, and the two-valued spin representation from a deeper 2-valued \nstatistics. \n \nFurthermore, Sidharth (2001a & 2001b) has discussed the nature of spin within the \ncontext of quantized fractal spacetime and showed that spin is symptomatic of the non-\ncommutative geometry of space-time at the Compton scale of a fermion and the three \ndimensionality of the space result from the spinorial behavior of fermions. He showed \nthat mathematically an imaginary shift of the spacetime coordinate in the Compton scale \nof a fermion introduces spin ½ into general relativity and curvature to the fermion theory \n(Sidharth, 2001a). The reason why an imaginary shift is associated with spin is to be \nfound in the quantum mechanical zitterbewegung within the Compton scale and the \nconsequent quantized fractal space-time (Sidharth, 2001a). Further, according to Sidharth \n(2001b), a fermion is like a Kerr-Newman Black Hole within the Compton scale of which \ncausality and locality fails. \n \n \nIII. Mystery of General Anesthesia \n \nIt should be stressed that there is no commonly accepted theory on how general \nanesthetics work (see Cantor, 1997; Hu and Wu, 2001; Koubi, 2000; Tu et al, 1998). \nHowever, there are two schools of thoughts on the issue. The first and oldest is the “lipid \ntheory” which proposes  that anesthetics dissolve into cell membranes and produce \ncommon structural perturbation resulting in depressed function of ion channels and \nreceptors that are involved in brain functions (see Cantor, 1997; Koubi, 2000; Tu et al, \n1998). However, there has been no direct experimental evidence to support the notion \nthat anesthetic perturbation of membrane depresses functions of membrane proteins (Hu \nand Wu, 2001).  \n \nThe second, more popular and recent theory is the “protein theory” which suggests that \nanesthetics directly interact with membrane proteins such as ion channels and receptors \nthat are involved in brain functions. But again there is no direct experimental evidence, \ne.g., that obtained by applying any of the established essays, such as radioligand-binding \nessay, to support the notion that general anesthetics specifically bind to these ion \nchannels and receptors (Hu and Wu, 2001). In addition, this theory doesn't seem to square \nwell with the low affinity and diversity of the general anesthetics. \n 5 \nFurthermore, in contrary to the general assumption that cell membranes are readily \npermeable to O2, existing publications support the possibility that these membranes are \nO2 transport barriers (see Hu, et al, 1992; Swartz, 1994). The lateral movement of O2 \nwithin the membrane to oxygen-utilizing protein may also encounter barriers. Further, the \nmovement of O2 in the protein to its site of utilization such as movement in a \nhydrophobic pocket may also encounter barriers. \n \nBoth theoretical and experimental studies have shown that many general anesthetics \ncause changes in membrane structures and properties at or just above the clinical \nconcentrations required for anesthesia (see Cantor, 1997; Hu and Wu, 2001; Koubi, 2000; \nTu et al, 1998). Further, as mentioned before, besides unconsciousness, general \nanesthesia is accompanied by overall depressed cerebral metabolic functions and \nsometimes hypoxia and acidosis (see Berthoud and Reilly, 1992; Fiset et al, 1999; \nHempel et al, 1975). It is well known that hypoxia induces hypo-metabolism (Lahiri, \n2000; Rohlicek et al, 1998). \n \nSince both O2 and general anesthetics are hydrophobic, we have speculated that the latter \nperturb the pathways of the former in both membranes and proteins (Hu and Wu, 2001). \nIn essence, we have proposed within the framework of conventional neuroscience that \ngeneral anesthetic may cause unconsciousness by perturbing O2 pathway in neural \nmembranes and O2-utilizing proteins, such that the availability of O2 to its sites of \nutilization is reduced, which in turn triggers cascading cellular responses through O2-\nsensing mechanisms, resulting in general anesthesia (Hu and Wu, 2001). \n \nIn addition, we have also been asking the question whether anesthetic perturbations of \nneural membranes and oxygen pathways themselves are the direct cause of \nunconsciousness. This conjuncture requires that molecular oxygen and neural membranes \nbe directly involved in consciousness. Indeed, The low affinity, diversity and \npervasiveness of general anesthetics point us to this direction. If we assume that \nconsciousness is an emergent property of the brain (Searle, 1992; Freeman, 20001) and \nfurther liken consciousness to the formation process of ice at 0 oC, anesthetic action \nwould be like the action of salt preventing the formation of ice at 0 oC. \n \n  \nIV. Nature of Consciousness \n \nThere is no coherent view as to what is and causes consciousness (see Goguen, 2002). \nSome neuroscientists would say that it is the connections between the neurons and the \ncoherent firing patterns thereof (e.g., Crick, 1994; Edelman, 1989). Some physicists \nwould propose that it is connected to the measurement problem in quantum theory and \nthus the solution lies there (e.g., Donald, 1990; Stapp, 1993; Penrose 1989 & 1994). A \nfew philosophers would suggest that it is an emergent property of the complex brain (e.g., \nSearle, 1992; Freeman, 2001) or a new kind of properties and laws are required \n(Chalmers, 1996).  The literature in these areas has become so vast that it is impossible to \ndiscuss here even the major views expressed therein. Interested readers are thus directed \nto the Journal of Consciousness Studies at http://www.imprint.co.uk/jcs.html and a list of \n 6 \nonline papers maintained by Chalmers (2002) for more exposure. For sure, such disarray \nhas its historical reasons. Ever since Descartes promoted his dualism philosophy in the \n17th Century, science has been for the most part steered clear from this subject until very \nrecently. \n \nPhilosophically, Searle (1992) argues that consciousness is an emergent biological \nphenomenon thus cannot be reduced to physical states in the brain (also see Freeman, \n2001). Chalmers (1996) argues that consciousness cannot be explained through reduction, \nbecause mind does not belong to the realm of matter. Thus, his approach is dualistic. In \norder to develop a consciousness theory based on this approach, he suggests expanding \nscience in a way still compatible with today’s scientific knowledge. Chalmers (1996) \noutlines a set of fundamental and irreducible properties to be added to space-time, mass, \ncharge, spin etc. and a set of laws to be added to the laws of Nature. Further, he considers \nthat information is the key to link consciousness and the physical world. \n \nOn the theoretical front, there are quite a few quantum theories of mind (e.g., Beck and \nEccles, 1992; Donald, 1990; Hameroff and Penrose, 1996; Penrose, 1989 & 1994; Stapp, \n1993; Walker, 2000). Among these, Penrose (1989 & 1994)’s Objective Reduction \n(“OR”) together with Hameroff (19 96)’s microtubule computation is perhaps the most \npopular, and the combination of the two produced the Orchestrated Objective Reduction \n(“Orch OR”) in microtubules (Hameroff and Penrose, 1996; Penrose, 1989 & 1994). \nAccording to Penrose (1989 & 1994), each quantum state has its own spacetime \ngeometry, thus superposition of quantum states entails superposition of different \nspacetime geometries. Under certain conditions, such spacetime geometric superposition \nwould separate under its own “weight” through a no n-computable process, which in turn \nwould collapse said quantum state superposition (Penrose, 1989 & 1994). Hameroff \n(1996) suggested that such self-organized OR could occur in microtubules because of \ntheir particular structures, thus, born the Orch OR. According Orch OR, each collapse of \nmacroscopic spacetime geometry superposition corresponds to a discrete conscious event. \nIn addition, it seems that Penrose does accept a separate mental world with grounding in \nthe physical world (Penrose, 1989 & 1994). \n \nThere are also a number of theories based on conventional neuroscience (e.g., Crick, \n1994; Edelman, 1989; LeDoux, 2002). Our view on these is that whatever the final \naccepted version based on neuroscience (“classical physics”), it may be accepted as \nclassically correct. The reason is that we must rely on the classical parts of the brain \nworking according to conventional neuroscience to provide us the necessary neural \ncomponents and wirings such as coherent neural firings, neurotransmitter releases and \nneural plasticity to support any realistic quantum activities of the brain. The situation is \nmuch like that in quantum computation where classical components form the supporting \nsystem of a quantum computer. Without these classical components, quantum \ncomputation could not be implemented at all. \n \n 7 \nIn comparison, our working philosophy is “pan -protopsychism” *.  We adopt the notion \nthat consciousness is grounded in physical reality (see Freeman, 2001; Penrose, 1989 & \n1994; Searle, 1992). Next, we ask “where” and “ho w.” To answer these, we take the \nreductionist approach both down to the end of physics to see what is left there and to the \nmicroscopic domain of a neuron to see what may be really important for the functioning \nof a conscious brain. What we found is that there is almost nothing left at the end of \nphysics except the fundamental ideas of quantized space-time and spin. On the other \nhand, we found that what may be really important in the microscopic domain of a neuron \nare the nuclear spin ensembles and the fluxes of biologically available unpaired electrons \ncarried by small molecules such as O2 and NO as mentioned earlier in this paper. \nNaturally, we draw the conclusion that quantum mechanical spin together with its \nconnection to spacetime geometry is needed to ground consciousness in physical reality \nsuch that conscious experience emerges from the collective dynamics of the neural \nnuclear spin ensembles under the influence of underlying spacetime dynamics. \n \nSpecifically, we try to answer these questions: (1) what are the neural substrates of \nconsciousness; (2) what physical processes are involved in conscious experience; (3) \nwhat physical and biochemical process are involved in connecting consciousness to the \nclassical neural networks of the brain and (4) what binding mechanism allows the mind to \nachieve unity. \n \n \nV. General Postulates \n \nWith above discussions in mind, we present the following Postulates with grounding on \nthe bottom of physical reality: \n \n(1) Consciousness is intrinsically connected to quantum mechanical spin since \nsaid spin is embedded in the microscopic structure of spacetime and may be \nmore fundamental than spacetime itself. That is, quantum mechanical spin is \nprotopsychic. \n \n(2) The “pixels” of a single mind are comprised of the unpaired nuclear spins \ndistributed in the neural membranes and proteins of the brain. The pixel-\nactivating agents of said mind are comprised of biologically available \nunpaired electronic spins. The records of a single mind are comprised of all \npossible entangled quantum states of the mind-pixels along with the \nunderlying spacetime geometries. \n \n \n(3) Conscious experience emerges from the collapses of said entangled quantum \nstates under the influence of underlying spacetime dynamics. The collapsing \nprocess may be non-computable. The unity of consciousness is achieved \nthrough quantum entanglement of the mind-pixels. \n                                                 \n*\n Though we hold a dualistic outlook similar to those advocated by Chalmers (1996) and Eccles (Beck and \nEccles, 1992). \n 8 \nIn Postulate (1), the intrinsic connection between quantum mechanical spin and mind is \ntheorized. Combining this fundamental idea with those stated in Postulates (2) and (3) \nallows us to build a qualitatively detailed working mechanism of consciousness as will be \nseen later. Further, since we assume that fermions are the building blocks of spacetime \nfabric, there is no independent background spacetime. \n \nIn Postulate (2), we hypothesize that the unpaired nuclear spins in both neural membranes \nand neural proteins serve as the “pixels” of a single mind. Why use unpaired fermionic \nspins as pixels of mind? The answer is that tightly paired/entangled fermionic spins in \nquantum state |S> = (1/[sqrt2])(|1/2>|-1/2> - |-1/2>|1/2>) have total spin zero and zero net \nmagnetic moment, thus zero spin and magnetic interactions with others. The reasons why \nboth neural membranes and proteins may be involved have been discussed before. \n \nIn theory the mind-pixels can self-activate by directly scanning and extracting \ninformation from their neural environment. But for reasons discussed later, the alternative \nis to have another group of fast moving unpaired electronic spins to do the job. \nSpecifically, we propose that biologically available unpaired electronic spins such as \nthose carried by O2 and neural transmitter NO to be the mind-pixel activating agents (we \ncall “spin beam”). This choice is dictated by what types of unpaired electronic spins a \nbiological brain actually possesses. \n \nIn addition, we propose that the records of a single mind are comprised of all possible \nentangled quantum states of mind-pixels along with the underlying spacetime geometries \nbecause of the intrinsic relationships between quantum mechanical spin and the \nunderlying microscopic structures of spacetime. It is not hard to see that the numbers and \nconfigurations of the constituent entangled quantum states depend on the history of said \nmind and is, thus, closely related to the concept of associative memory in neuroscience as \nwill be discussed in more detail later. \n \nIn Postulate (3), we propose how conscious experience emerges. Since there are at the \npresent several ontological interpretations of quantum mechanics with respect to the \nmeasurement problem, we accept, as the cause of conscious experience, the collapses of \nentangled quantum states of the mind-pixels under the influence of the underlying \nspacetime dynamics. We further theorize that the unity of consciousness is achieved \nthrough quantum entanglements of these mind-pixels. The idea of mind unity through \nentanglement is not new (e.g., Stapp, 1993). \n \nIn doing so, we have adopted a collapsing scheme similar to that advocated by Penrose \n(1989 & 1994) known as “objective reduction (“O R”)” within which conscious \nexperience emerges from one or a set of collapses of said entangled quantum states due to \nthe separation of the underlying spacetime geometries through non-computable means \n(Penrose, 1989 & 1994). \n \nFinally, it has been claimed by some that there is no large-scale quantum coherence in the \nwarm and wet brain according to the decoherence theory (e.g., Tegmark, 2000). \nHowever, as will be discussed later, this claim does not seem to apply to nuclear spin \n 9 \nensembles in neural membranes and proteins. Further, even if we assume the claim is \ntrue, consciousness can still emerge from the statistical mixtures of coherent and \nincoherent quantum states of the mind pixels, as long as we either accept some kind of \nquantum emergence theory (Freeman, 2001; Searle, 1992) or take a dualistic approach \n(see, Chalmers, 1996, Beck and Eccles, 1992) as will be discussed again later. \n  \n \nVI.  Mechanism of Spin-Mediated Consciousness and Memory \n \nOverview \nFigure 1 is a highly schematic drawing of the overall picture of a spin-mediated \nconsciousness model proposed herein. At this stage, the model is qualitative. A \nquantitative model will be built in the future. At the top of Figure 1, a two-neuron \nnetwork is shown. The connections between the two neurons are made at the two \nsynapses each of which consists of a synaptic knob with synaptic vesicles inside, a \nsynaptic cleft where the neurotransmitters are released from an infusing synaptic vesicle \nat the presynaptic membrane on the knob, and a postsynaptic membrane located on the \ndendrite or the soma. The neural activities of the postsynaptic membrane are immediately \nshown below the neurons in Figure 1. These activities include biochemical reactions \nimmediately following the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft, the ensuing \ncollective activities of multiple ion channels and the action potentials and their \npropagations thereof, and other enzymatic activities. \n \nThe present model is mainly concerned with the spin dynamics of the proton nuclear spin \nensembles in neural membranes and proteins such as those on the dendrites and soma \nunder repeated activations by biologically available unpaired electronic spins, such as \nthose carried by rapidly diffusing O2 and neural transmitter NO, and the connections of \nsuch dynamics to underlying spacetime dynamics and, ultimately, conscious experience. \nThe input and out information flows of said nuclear spin ensembles are schematically \nshown in the middle of Figure 1. On the bottom of Figure 1, what a single conscious \nmind perceives is schematically shown. The mechanism of spin-mediated consciousness \nincluding conscious experience will be described below. \n \nNuclear spin ensemble \nFigure 2 shows side-by-side the chemical structure and atomic model of a typical \nphospholipid found in neural membranes together with the diffusing O2 in Lewis \nstructure and atomic model respectively. A similar but complex picture can be drawn for \na neural protein with the presence of O2. As can be seen, each phospholipid molecule \ncontains more than 60 hydrogen atoms on its double lipid chains each of which contains \nproton nuclear spin ½.  Because the small mobility of a proton in comparison to an \nelectron, proton nuclear spins can only interact with each other and the environment \nthrough their small magnetic dipoles associated with their nuclear spin ½. That is why \nthey have such long relaxation time after excitations (Morris, 1986). This property of \nproton nuclear spins is ideal for them to be used as mind-pixels. In addition, these nuclear \nspins can form various intra/inter-molecularly entangled quantum states under different \nexternal activations (see Khitrin et al, 2002; Khitrin and Ermakobv, 2002). These \n 10 \nentangled states represent different information to the mind. Thus, the proton nuclear \nspins of the two lipid chains of each phospholipid can serve as one pixel of a biological \nmind. \n \nSpin beam \nThere are several reasons favoring a spin beam comprised of biologically available \nunpaired electrons. The nuclear spins ensembles in neural membranes and proteins alone \nare probably unable to extract useful information from said membranes and proteins \nbecause, as mentioned above, nuclear spins have small mobility and can only interact \nwith their environment through their small magnetic dipoles. Thus, they probably can \nonly feel the thermal noise from their surroundings without external activations. \n \nIn contrast, an electron, even attached to a molecule, is much more mobile and can \ninteract with its environment and themselves through collision-induced conformational \nchanges, spin-orbital coupling, its large magnetic dipole, and even Heisenberg exchange \ninteractions under some circumstances (see Wertz, 1972). The magnetogyric ratio of the \nelectron is about three orders of magnetude larger than that of the proton nuclear spin, \nwhich allows an electron to produce a strong and fluctuating magnetic field along its path \nof diffusion (see Wertz, 1972). Thus, the mobility and large magnetic dipole of an \nelectron allow it to strongly interact with a nuclear spin through either its magnetic dipole \nor Fermi-contact interaction. Thus, a stable or semi-stable unpaired electron hosted in a \nsuitable molecule is able to extract information from the diffusing path of the molecule \nand communicate said information to the nearby nuclear spins in the nuclear spin \nensembles in neural membranes and proteins. \n \nIt turns out that among others O2 and neural transmitter NO are such suitable molecules. \nO2 contains two unpaired electronic spins that are in triplet state with a total spin S = 1. In \nthe absence of a strong external magnetic field, the triplet spin state is degenerate. It can \nbe expressed as |S> = a|1> + b|0> + c|-1> where |1> = |1/2>|1/2>, |0> = (1/[sqrt2])( |1/2>|-\n1/2> + |-1/2>|1/2> ) and |-1> = |-1/2>|-1/2>. Similarly, NO contains one unpaired \nelectronic spin with a total spin S = 1/2. In the absence of a strong external magnetic \nfield, the spin state is degenerate. It can be expressed as |S> = a|1/2> + b|-1/2>. \nS can interact strongly with a nuclear spin cluster in a phospholipid, protein or other large \nbiological molecules through Fermi-contact or dipole-dipole interaction as O2 or NO \nrapidly diffusing through the neural membrane or protein so as to transfer the information \nit learned from its path of diffusion to the nuclear spin clusters along the path, while |S> \nevolves successively under a time-dependent Hamaltonian H according to the \nSchrodinger equation. \n \nSpin-Mediated Mechanism \nThe key circuits of spin-mediated consciousness are outlined here. The nuclear spin \nensembles (“N SE”) in both neural membranes and proteins quantum mechanically \nprocess consciousness-related information such that conscious experience emerges from \nthe collapses of entangled quantum states of NSE under the influence of the underlying \nspacetime dynamics. Said information is communicated to NSE through strong spin-spin \ncouplings by biologically available unpaired electronic spins such as those carried by \n 11 \nrapidly diffusing O2 and neural transmitter NO that extract information from their \ndiffusing pathways in the brain. In turn, the dynamics of NSE has effects through spin \nchemistry on the classical neural activities such as action potentials and receptor \nfunctions thus influencing the classical neural networks of said brain. Our proposal calls \nfor associative encoding of neural memories in the dynamical structures of neural \nmembranes and proteins. Therefore, according to the present theory: (1) the dynamical \nnuclear spin ensembles are the “screen” of mind with nuclear spins as its pixels; (2) the \nneural membranes and proteins are the mind-screen and neural memory hosts; and (3) the \nfluxes of biologically available unpaired electrons spins are the spin beam for information \nretrieval, communication and pixel-activation. Together, they form the neural substrates \nof consciousness. \n \nQuantum coherence with entanglement \nThere are both theoretical and experimental research results indicating the strong \npossibility of large-scale quantum coherence with entanglement in the nuclear spin \nensembles distributed in neural membranes and proteins of the warm and wet brain (e.g., \nKhitrin and Ermakov, 2002; Khitrin et al, 2002a & 2002b; Kun et al, 2002; Julsgaard et \nal, 2001; Warren et al, 1993 & 1998). \n \nFirst, in a series of experiments, Khitrin et al (2000, 2002a & 2002b) have demonstrated \nthat a cluster of dipolar coupled proton nuclear spins in the molecules of a nematic liquid \ncrystal at room temperature can be manipulated to achieve long-lived intra-molecular \nquantum coherence with entanglement such that a large amount of information may be \nstored in said cluster. In particular, they have succeeded in storing at room temperature a \n2D pattern consisting of 1025 bits of information in the proton nuclear spin states of a \nmolecular system of the nematic liquid crystal and then retrieved the same as a stack of \nNMR spectra (Khitrin et al, 2002b). \n \nSecond, about a decade ago Warren et al (1993 & 1998) have discovered long-ranged \nintermolecular multiple-quantum coherence in NMR spectroscopy and imaging and have \nsince successfully applied said coherence as MRI contrast agents. Indeed, they found that \neven the intermolecular dipolar couplings of the nuclear spins at distances larger than 10 \nmicrons are not averaged away by diffusions (Warren et al, 1993 & 1998). \n \nThird, Julsgaard et al (2001) have first theoretically predicted and then experimentally \ndemonstrated at room temperature a long-lived entanglement of two macroscopic spin \nensembles formed by two caesium gas samples each of which contains about 1012 atoms. \nThe entangled spin-state can be maintained for 0.5 milliseconds and was generated via \ninteractions of the samples with a pulse of light (Julsgaard et al, 2001). The state they \ndemonstrated is not a maximally entangled “Schrödinger cat” state but a state similar to a \ntwo-mode squeezed state; thus, it is an example of a non-maximally entangled state \n(Julsgaard et al, 2001). In addition, Kun et al (2002) have theoretically predicted a \n“Schrödinger cat” state to be found in highly -excited and strongly-interacting many-body \nsystem.  \n \n 12 \nThe results discussed above go heavily against the claim that there is no large-scale \nquantum coherence in the warm and wet brain (e.g., Tegmark, 2000). At least, this claim \ndoes not seem to apply to the nuclear spin ensembles in neural membranes and proteins. \nFurther, in the case of Penrose-Hameroff microtubule model (Penrose, 1994; Hameroff \nand Penrose, 1996), it was strongly argued by Hagan et al (2002) that Tegmark (2000)’s \ntheorectical calculations also do not apply.  \n  \n“Consciousness explained” \nThe mechanism of consciousness according to our current proposals is schematically shown at \nthe bottom of Figure 1. The geometry inside the spinning circle represents conscious experience \nand is part of a Penrose tiling (1989) generated from a java script available at \nhttp://freeabel.geom.umn.edu/apps/quasitiler/about.html. It symbolizes in the Penrose spirit \n(1989) that consciousness emerges from the non-computable collapses of entangled quantum \nstates of the mind-pixels under the influence of spacetime dynamics schematically shown as the \nspinning circle in Figure 1. The edges in the Penrose tiling represent unpaired nuclear spins in \nneural membranes and proteins as mind-pixels, the nodes represent interactions between these \nnuclear spins and the colors represent activations of mind-pixels by biologically available \nunpaired electronic spins such as those carried by O2 and neural transmitter NO. The whole tiling \npattern in Figure 1 represents conscious experience and the underlying spacetime geometry. This \npattern successively evolves under repeated activations by the spin beam representing successive \ncollapses of entangled quantum states of the mind-pixels as a stream of conscious experience. \n \nIn proposing said mechanism of consciousness, we have adopted Penrose (1989 & 1994)’s long -\nstanding view that human thought may involve non-computable processes, as Gödel's theorem of \nincompleteness would suggest. According to Gödel, any consistent system of axioms beyond a \ncertain basic level of complexity yields statements that cannot be proved or disproved with said \naxioms. Yet human can decide whether those statements are true, thus human thought cannot be \nreduced to a set of rules or computations (Penrose 1989 & 1994). \n \nSo where can one find non-computable process in physics? Obviously it cannot be found in \nclassical physics because classical physics is deterministic so, in principle, can be simulated by a \ncomputer (Penrose, 1989 & 1994). Thus, Penrose reasoned that some kind of non-computable \nquantum process must be involved in consciousness and further suggested gravity-induced \nreduction (“R”) process of quantum state superposition to be the candidate  (Penrose, 1989 & \n1994). According to Penrose, each quantum state has its own spacetime geometry, thus \nsuperposition of quantum states entails superposition of different spacetime geometries. Under \ncertain conditions, such spacetime geometric superposition would separate under its own \n“weight” through a no n-computable process, which in turn would collapse said quantum state \nsuperposition (Penrose, 1989 & 1994).  \n \nIn proposing herein described mechanism of consciousness we have also adopted a view similar \nto Penrose’s above suggestion. One may recall that, a ccording to Einstein’s theory of general \nrelativity, gravity is spacetime geometry and, further, as we have discussed before quantum \nmechanical spin is embedded in the microscopic structure of spacetime. Therefore, the quantum \nstate of said spin must be influenced by the underlying spacetime geometry. However, we still \nhave the task of working out the details in future research. This will be especially difficult \nbecause at the present we do not have a satisfactory theory of quantum gravity. \n \n \n 13 \nAlternative approaches to consciousness \nAs mentioned earlier, some scientists have claimed that there is no large-scale quantum \ncoherence in the warm and wet brain because of decoherence (e.g., Tegmark, 2000). If \nwe assume that this claim is true, how can consciousness still emerge from statistically \nmixed quantum states of the nuclear spin ensembles in neural membranes and proteins? \nThere are indeed at least two ways out. The first is to adopt a quantum emergence theory \n(see Freeman, 2001; Searle, 1992) and the second is to take a dualistic approach (see \nChalmers, 1996; Beck and Eccles, 1992). Here, we will focus our discussion on the \ndualistic approach.  \n \nWe can assume that mind exists and resides in a pre-spacetime. Then, the question \nbecomes how does mind process and harness the information received from the spin \nbeam so that it can have conscious experience? We can theorize that conscious \nexperience emerges from those quantum states of the mind-pixels in the statistical \nmixtures that have grabbed the attention of the mind through quantum Zeno effect (e.g., \nStapp, 1993) or some non-local means in pre-spacetime. Indeed, the many-mind \ninterpretation of quantum theory as proposed by Donald (1990) supports this type of \nformulation. Thus, in this scenario, mind does not depend on large quantum coherence to \nwork. \n \nFurthermore, each proton nuclear spin is a qubit, each O2 spin triplet is tightly entangled \ntwo-qubit and there exist coherent and incoherent intra-molecular superpositions of \nmultiple nuclear spins under external stimulations (see Khitrin et al, 2002a &2002b; \nKhitrin and Ermakobv, 2002). Further, liquid NMR quantum computation is a reality \n(Nielsen and Chuang, 2000; Yannoni et al, 1999). So, mind, if exists, must have utilized \nthese quantum resources to implement some kind of quantum processing in order to \nharness information. \n \nIt is also plausible that mind have utilized quantum statistical computations similar to \nthose proposed by Castagnoli and Finkelstein (2001). In their model, a triode network \nmade of triplet pairs of spin ½ fermions and their quantum statistical relations due to \nparticle indistinguishability was utilized to implement the computation, together with a \nrandomly-varying magnetic field as heat bath for annealing (Castagnoli and Finkelstein, \n2001). The scheme develops quantum parallelism through the incoherent superposition of \nparallel computation paths (i.e., the mixtures). It replaces the superposition of coherent \nparallel computation paths with the almost indestructible superposition of different \npermutations of identical particles subject to a given statistics, thus surviving \ndecoherence (Castagnoli and Finkelstein, 2001). \n \nAssociative memory model \nWe have proposed that the records of a single mind are comprised of all possible \nentangled quantum states of the mind-pixels along with the underlying spacetime \ngeometries. We have also pointed out that the numbers and configurations of the \nconstituent entangled quantum states of said records depend on the history of said single \nmind and are connected to the classical associative memory in neuroscience. The \nquestion is how are they connected? The answer is that, since the nuclear spins as the \n 14 \nmind-pixels are distributed in the neural membranes and proteins, the latter form the \nclassical support system of the records of said single mind, thus the matrices of classical \nassociative memory. Thus, we proposed that the classical associative memory is \ncomprised of the conformational changes of neural membranes and proteins and the \ncorresponding changes in their dynamical behaviors (see Marder et al, 1996). \n \nA few illustrations are given here. Figure 3 (a) schematically shows a neural membrane \ncontaining only the same phospholipids. Such a membrane is much like a blank tape. \nFigure 3 (b) shows the same neural membrane after cholesterols are added. The changes \nin membrane configuration are quite noticeable (Raffy and Teissie, 1999; Smondyrev and \nBerkowitz, 1999). These changes can represent memory or information that can be read \nby a spin beam. Figure 3 (c) shows the chemical structure and atomic model of a stearic \nacid molecule - a saturated fatty acid. Figure 3 (d) shows the chemical structure and \natomic model of oleic acid molecule – an unsaturated fatty acid. The only difference \nbetween the two fatty acids is that the latter contains a double bond in the middle that \ncauses its kink formation when the double bond is in the cis form. When the double bond \nis in the trans form, the chain is doubly bent so there is no kink. Certainly insert either \none of the fatty acids into the membrane shown in Figure 3 (b)\n \nwould further increase its \ncomplexity thus information content. Furthermore, insertions of proteins to neural \nmembranes also significantly change their conformation and dynamics surrounding the \ninserted proteins (Woolf and Roux, 1996). Thus, inserting different proteins to neural \nmembranes both in numbers and types can significantly increase the information content \nof the neural membranes. \n \nHowever, as we have discussed earlier, nuclear spins by themselves are probably unable \nto extract useful information from their neural environment, because they have small \nmobility and can only interact with said environment through their small magnetic \ndipoles. According the present theory, it is biologically available unpaired electronic \nspins as spin beams that are able to extract information from their diffusing paths and \ncommunicate said information to the mind-pixels thus activating the latter for \nconsciousness-related processing.  \n \nInterface with classical neural networks \nWe speculate that there are two parts to the interface between spin-mediated conscious \nfunctions (“SMCF”) and classical neural activities (“CNA”). The “input circuit” from \nCNA to SMCF is responsible for converting classical neural activities into the dynamics \nof neural membranes and proteins from which spin beam can extract information. The \nvery weak magnetic field collectively produced by all neural activities may also directly \nserve as the input to SMCF but its effect on SMCF is probably negligible in comparison \nthe strong fluctuating magnetic field produced by the rapidly diffusing unpaired \nelectronic spins in the spin beam as discussed below. The output circuit from SMCF to \nCNA is responsible for converting the functional output of SMCF into classical neural \nactivities through spin chemistry and possibly other mechanisms. \n \nWith respect to the herein speculated input circuit, published studies showed that the \ndynamics of membrane proteins significantly affect the dynamics of surrounding \n 15 \nmembranes (e.g., Marder et al, 1996; Woolf and Roux, 1996). Secondly, due to the very \nsmall thickness of the neural membrane (roughly 5 nm), even the small voltage (roughly \n~50 mV) of an action potential can create enormous oscillating electric field inside the \nneural membranes that in turn can change the dynamics of the membrane components \nsuch as phospholipid and proteins through its interactions with the electric dipoles of \nthese components (e.g., Akinlaja and Sachs, 1998; Sens and Isambert, 2001). Therefore, \nthe classical neural activities of ion channels and receptors can affect, through at least \ntwo ways, the dynamics of the neural membranes and proteins from which spin beam can \nextract information. In addition, said electric field may directly effect the collective \ndynamics of the nuclear spin ensembles in neural membranes and proteins (e.g., \nChapovsky, 2001). \n \nFurther, the electrical current accompanying the collective neuron firings could also \nproduce a magnetic field in the order of 10-12 Tesla (Wikswo, 1990). In comparison, the \nmagnetic field strength of earth is 5×10-5 Tesla (Wikswo, 1990), and the nuclear spin \nensembles in neural membanes and proteins and biologically available unspired \nelectronic spins such as those carried by O2 and NO may, under some circumstances, \nproduce a fluctuating local magnetic field in the ranges of a few Tesla (Slichter, 1990; \nWertz, 1972). Thus, the effect of the magnetic field produced by classical neural activity \non SMCF is negligible. \n \nAs to the herein speculated output circuit, many biochemical reactions mediated by \nradical pairs and biradicals, such as those dual path radical reactions driven/initiated by \nNO and active oxygen species, have been found to be influenced by the magnetic field in \ntheir local environment (Hayashi, 2002; Nagakura et al, 1998). Thus, the functional \noutput of SMCF, being the varying local magnetic field generated by the dynamics of the \nnuclear spin ensembles as mind-pixels, can directly affect classical neural activities. \nFurther, there may be other mechanisms through which the functional output of SMCF \ncan affect the classical neural activities of the brain. \n \nMechanism of anesthetic action \nAs mentioned earlier in this paper, the mechanism of anesthetic action is closely related \nto the inner workings of consciousness (Hu and Wu, 2001). We describe here said \nmechanism in accordance with our present theory. Figure 4 (a) schematically shows the \nnormal diffusion of biologically available unpaired electrons such as those carried by O2 \nand neural transmitter NO without anesthetics dissolved into neural membranes and \nproteins. As these molecules rapidly diffuse through the membranes and proteins, their \nunpaired electrons in various spin states extract information from the membranes and \nproteins along their diffusion paths and communicate said information through strong \nspin-spin couplings to nearby unpaired nuclear spins such as proton nuclear spins for \nconsciousness-related quantum mechanical processing. Figure 4 (b) schematically shows \nanesthetic perturbations of O2 and NO pathways and neural membranes themselves by \nanesthetic molecules and the resulting distortion and/or obstruction of these pathways. A \nsimilar picture can be drawn for neural proteins and other components. Such \nperturbations result in O2 and NO not being able to perform their spin beam functions \nsuch as extracting information from the neural membranes and proteins and nuclear spin \n 16 \nensembles not being able to perform its normal mind-pixel functions resulting in altered \nmental state or unconsciousness. \n \n \nVII. Important Predictions and Supporting Evidence \n \nSeveral experimentally verifiable predictions can be drawn from the theory of \nconsciousness proposed herein: \n \n(1) Any mean that significantly replaces hydrogen atoms of the neural membranes \nwith those with zero nuclear spin such as deuterium will interferes with or \ntotally block the conscious functions of the brain; \n \n(2) Any agent or mean that significantly interferes with the dynamics of the \nnuclear spin ensembles in neural membranes will interfere with the conscious \nfunctions of the brain; \n \n(3) Any agent or mean that significantly perturbs the structure or dynamics of the \nneural membranes will alter or disrupt the normal functions of consciousness; \n \n \n(4) Any agent or mean that significantly perturbs or interferes with the oxygen \npathway inside the neural membranes will diminish or block consciousness; & \n \n(5) Any mean that stops oxygen flow through neural membranes will disrupt \nconscious functions of the brain even if everything else in the brain functions \nnormally. \n \nOf course, other important predictions and inferences can also be drawn from the present \ntheory. But we will focus our discussions on the above listed a few to see whether there \nare any experimental evidence supporting these predictions. \n \nWith respect to (1), there are published results concerning the biological effects of heavy \nwater, in which proton is replaced by deuterium - the spin zero isotope of hydrogen, \nwhich lend support to our proposal of the mind-pixels being based on proton nuclear spin \nensembles in neural membranes and possibly proteins (see Kushner et al, 1999). Indeed, \nthe only observable physical and chemical difference between regular and heavy water is \nthat the latter has a slightly higher viscosity (Kushner et al, 1999). For example, it was \nreported that rats restricted to heavy water (99.8%) would drink it freely the first day, \nthen drank progressively less and died within 14 days (Richter, 1976). It was also \nreported that the incremental increase of the amount of heavy water in regular drinking \nwater lengthened the 24-hour clock of the Circadian rhythm in blind hamsters or normal \nhamsters kept in constant darkness (Richter, 1977). In principle, these observations can \nbe explained as animals literally loosing their minds because of the loss of their mind-\npixels due to gradual deuterium substitutions of protons in neural membranes and \nproteins.  The complication is that the higher viscosity of heavy water might have also \n 17 \ncontributed to the observed effects. It is possible to design a better experimental \nprocedure to either account for or exclude those effects attributable to the higher \nviscosity. \n \nAs far as (2) is concerned, there also exist quite a few published results based on \ntranscranial magnetic stimulation (“TMS”) that can all be explained based on our \nproposals desribed herein (e.g., Limoniemi et al, 1997; also see Chicurei, 2002), although \nthe common wisdom is that TMS induces electrical currents in the brain, causing \ndepolarization of cellular membranes and thereby neural activation (Limoniemi et al, \n1997). What TMS does is that it creates random neural noise through millisecond \nmagnetic pulses that in turn produces temporary neural lesion (Chicurei, 2002). It has \nbeen found that depending on the locations of stimulation TMS affects the test subject’s \nverbal ability, visualization and other conscious functions  (Chicurei, 2002). \n \nAccording to our proposals, TMS directly affects the dynamics of nuclear spin ensembles \nin neural membranes and proteins as the mind-pixels and possibly that of biologically \navailable unpaired electronic spins as the spin beam, which in turn result in altered, \ndiminished and/or disrupted conscious functions of the brain as reported by the TMS-\nrelated literatures (e.g., Limoniemi et al, 1997; Chicurei, 2002). \n \nWith respect to (3) and (4), many general anesthetics have been found to disturb the \nstructures and dynamics of neural membranes (see Cantor, 1997; Hu and Wu, 2001; \nKoubi et al, 2000; Tu et al, 1998). Thus, the mechanism of their anesthetic action can be \ninterpreted, according the instant theory, as their direct effects on O2 pathways and \nnuclear spin ensembles inside the neural membranes and proteins. Our other paper (Hu \nand Wu, 2001) contains a more detailed treatment on anesthetic perturbations of oxygen \npathways and membranes themselves. \n \nHere we will focus our attention on one particularly small anesthetic agent, the nitrous \noxide (N2O), also known as the laughing gas. Indeed, the size of N2O is similar to that of \nO2 but it does not contain unpaired electrons and is not reactive.  It has low polarity that \nmakes it soluble in both water and lipid. Thus, it can be carried to the brain through blood \nstream and accumulate in the neural membranes. Inhalation of N2O will cause \ndisorientation, euphoria, numbness and ultimately loss of consciousness if the inhalation \ndosage is high. The cellular mechanism of these actions by N2O is so far unknown but \nseems confined to postsynaptic targets (Mennerick et al, 1998). On the other hand, its \nclosely related “cousin” nitric oxide (NO)  contains one unpaired electron and has been \ndiscovered as the first small and highly diffusive neural transmitter produced in the brain \nthrough enzymatic reactions (see Philippides et al, 2000). \n \nAccording to our theory of spin-mediated consciousness, there indeed exist a natural and \nstraightforward explanation.  By dissolving into neural membranes in an inhalation-dose-\ndependent fashion, N2O gradually displace O2 in their membrane pathways thus diminish \nor totally block the spin beam function of O2. \n \n 18 \nWith respect to (5), it is probably very hard to deprive brain oxygen and yet at the same \ntime require its neurons to keep their metabolic functions normal since oxygen is an \nessential component of brain energy production (Magistretti et al, 2002).  However, \naccording to the present theory, in many cases of temporary-hypoxia-induced \nunconsciousness such as those due to sudden loss of air pressure on an airplane, the \nactually cause may not be the depletion of brain energy resources because of the lack of \noxygen, but the loss of mind-pixel activating agents, the oxygen spin beam.  This \nscenario should be testable in a suitable animal model. \n \nFinally, we turn our attention to the associative memory model based on neural \nmembrane plasticity proposed herein. There are tens of thousands of research papers on \nthe subject of synaptic plasticity/modification (e.g., Fu et al, 2002). The commonly \naccepted assumption in neuroscience is that synaptic efficacy is both necessary and \nsufficient to account for learning and memory (see Marder et al, 1996). Our associative \nmemory model not only does not conflict with the synaptic efficacy view but also provide \nmore details because, according the present theory, the postsynaptic membranes and \nproteins on the dendrites and soma, which are part of the synapses, are the main sites of \nmicro-consciousness. However, our theory also encompasses other parts of the neural \nmembranes of the neurons and other neural proteins since all of the sites of micro-\nconsciousness must also be dynamical connected in order to formed a unified mind \nthrough entanglement. Indeed, classical neural activities modify not only the synaptic \nefficacy but also the intrinsic properties of the neuron (see Marder et al, 1996). \n \n \nVIII. Conclusions \n \nOur current expedition to the terrains of mind-matter is guided by our working \nphilosophy that consciousness is grounded in the bottom of physical reality and emerges \nfrom the collective dynamics of known physical candidates inside the brain. We strongly \nbelieve that quantum mechanical spins are such candidates because they are the most \nfundamental entities in modern physics and, on the other hand, neural membranes and \nproteins are saturated with these spins through chemically bound hydrogen atoms, rapidly \ndiffusing oxygen molecules and neural transmitter nitric oxides and other neural \nsubstances. That is, quantum mechanical spin is protopsychic and our working \nphilosophy is pan-protopsychism. We have applied reductionist approaches in both \nphysics and neuroscience to reach our tentative conclusions. However, our present theory \nas it stands now is speculative and only qualitatively detailed. A quantitative model will \nbe built in the future. \n \nWe have made important predictions from our theory and presented experimental \nevidence in support of the same. We have also suggested new experiments to verify the \npresent proposals. We stress that our predictions experimentally verifiable with the \npresent technologies. Indeed, recent experimental realizations of intra-/inter-molecular \nnuclear spin coherence and entanglement, macroscopic entanglement of spin ensembles \nand NMR quantum computation, all in room temperatures, strongly suggest the \npossibility of a spin-mediated mind. \n 19 \n \nHowever, we would like to caution that even if the instant proposals are confirmed partly \nor as a whole by more experiments it will only mark the beginning of a new direction \ntowards a better understanding of our mind. There are still many questions need to be \nanswered, especially those “hard problems” (Chalmers, 1996). Fo r example, what are the \nroles of other nuclear-spin-containing isotopes (“impurities”) of biologically essential \natoms such as C17.Are they part of the mind-pixels? Do they represent different emotions \nor feeling of our mind when strongly coupled to the proton nuclear spin ensembles? What \nare the roles of other biological available unpaired electronic spins besides those carried \nby oxygen molecules and neural transmitter nitric oxides? Are they related to the \ndifferent perceptions of mind? \n \nIn summary, a novel theory of consciousness is proposed in this paper. We postulate that \nconsciousness is intrinsically connected to quantum mechanical spin since said spin is \nembedded in the microscopic structure of spacetime and may be more fundamental than \nspacetime itself. Thus, we theorize that consciousness emerges quantum mechanically \nfrom the collective dynamics of “protopsychic” spins under the influence of spacetime \ndynamics. That is, spin is the “pixel” of mind. The unity of mind is achieved by quantum \nentanglement of the mind-pixels.  \n \nApplying these ideas to the particular structures and dynamics of the brain, we postulate \nthat the human mind works as follows: The nuclear spin ensembles (“NSE”) in both \nneural membranes and proteins quantum mechanically process consciousness-related \ninformation such that conscious experience emerges from the collapses of entangled \nquantum states of NSE under the influence of the underlying spacetime dynamics. Said \ninformation is communicated to NSE through strong spin-spin couplings by biologically \navailable unpaired electronic spins such as those carried by rapidly diffusing oxygen \nmolecules and neural transmitter nitric oxides that extract information from their \ndiffusing pathways in the brain. In turn, the dynamics of NSE has effects through spin \nchemistry on the classical neural activities such as action potentials and receptor \nfunctions thus influencing the classical neural networks of said brain. Our proposal calls \nfor associative encoding of neural memories in the dynamical structures of neural \nmembranes and proteins.  \n \nTherefore, according to the present theory: (1) the dynamical nuclear spin ensembles are \nthe “screen” of mind with nuclear spins as its pixels; (2) the neural membranes and \nproteins are the mind-screen and neural memory hosts; and (3) the fluxes of biologically \navailable unpaired electrons spins are the spin beam for information retrieval, \ncommunication and pixel-activation. Together, they form the neural substrates of \nconsciousness.  \n \nReferences \nAkinlaja, J. and Sachs, F. (1998), ‘The breakdown of cell membranes by electrical and \nmechanical stress’, Biophys.

Schematic drawing of the mechanism of consciousness according to the \npresent theory. The drawing is self-explanatory except the part dealing with \nconscious experience. The geometry inside the spinning circle represents \nconscious experience and is part of a Penrose tiling (1989) generated from a java \nscript available at http://freeabel.geom.umn.edu/apps/quasitiler/about.html. It \nsymbolizes in the Penrose spirit (1989) that consciousness is about quantum \ncoherence with entanglement (non-locality and co-operation), non-computability \nand quantum state collapses under the influence of spacetime dynamics (the \ncircle). The edges in the tiling represent unpaired nuclear spins in neural \n 26 \nmembranes and proteins as mind-pixels, the nodes represent interactions between \nthese nuclear spins and the colors represent activations of mind-pixels by \nbiologically available unpaired electronic spins such as those carried by O2 and \nneural transmitter NO. The whole tiling pattern represents conscious experience \nand the underlying spacetime geometry. This pattern successively evolves under \nrepeated activations by the spin beam representing successive collapses of \nentangled quantum states of the mind-pixels as a stream of conscious experience. \n \n \n \nFigure 2. Schematic drawings of chemical structure (a) and atomic model (c) of \na typical phospholipid with diffusing O2 in Lewis structure (b) and atomic model \n(d) shown along the side. Two unpaired electronic electrons are shown in Lewis \nstructure as two red dots (b). They are in triplet spin state. In the atomic model, \nthe white, black, purple and orange balls respectively represent hydrogen, carbon, \noxygen and phosphonium atoms. A similar but more complex figure can also be \ndrawn for a neural protein surrounded by O2 and/or NO. \n \n \n \n 27 \n \nFigure 3. Schematic drawings of an associative memory model. a shows a neural \nmembrane containing only the same phospholipids. Such a membrane is much \nlike a blank tape. b shows the neural membrane after cholesterols are added. The \nchanges in membrane configuration are quite noticeable. These changes represent \nmemory or information that can be extracted by spin beam. c shows the chemical \nstructure and atomic model of a stearic acid molecule - a saturated fatty acid. d \nshows the chemical structure and atomic model of oleic acid molecule – a \nunsaturated fatty acid. The only difference between the two fatty acids is that the \nlatter contains a double bond in the middle that causes its kink formation when \nthe double bond is the cis form. When the double bond is in the trans form, the \nchain is doubly bent so there is no kink. Certainly insert either one of the fatty \nacids into the membrane shown in b would further increase its complexity thus \ninformation content. A similar but much more complex picture can be drawn for \na neural protein with its conformational changes as memory/information. \n \n \n 28 \n \nFigure 4. Schematic drawings of the mechanism of anesthetic action. a shows the \nnormal diffusion of O2 without anesthetics dissolved into neural. As O2 rapidly \ndiffuse through the neural membranes, their unpaired electrons extract \ninformation from the membranes along their diffusion paths and communicate \nsaid information through strong spin-spin couplings to nearby nuclear spins for \nconsciousness-related processing. b shows anesthetic perturbations of O2 \npathways and neural membranes themselves by anesthetic molecules and the \nresulting in distortion and/or obstruction of O2 pathways and even disturbance to \nthe conformations of membrane components. Such perturbations result in O2 \nbeing able to perform their normal spin beam functions such as extracting \ninformation from the membranes and proteins and nuclear spin ensembles in \nneural membranes and proteins not being able to perform their normal mind-\npixel functions resulting in altered mental state or unconsciousness. Neural \ntransmitter NO can also be included in the picture. \n",

Most of the respondents (83.8%) indicated their communication skills are as important as technical skills in terms of achieving positive patient outcomes. Between one-third and one-half of the respondents, depending on the educational level queried, rated their communications skills training as being inadequate. Fewer than 20% of the respondents rated the communications skills training they received as being excellent. Physicians indicated a need to improve their use of 8 of 13 specific communication strategies during patient encounters, and reported using few communication strategies during the closing minutes of the encounter.

Well-designed communications skills training programs should be implemented\nat multi-levels of physician training in order to improve patient satisfaction with their encounters\nwith family/general practitioners, and to increase the likelihood of positive patient outcomes.\nIt has been almost a decade since a consensus\nmeeting in Toronto concluded that, “Sufficient data\nhave now accumulated to prove that problems in\ndoctor-patient communication are extremely common\nand adversely affect patient management.”1 Avail-\nable data indicate the quality of doctor-patient com-\nmunication has a significant impact on patient satis-\nfaction,2 medical outcomes,3,4 medical costs, and\neven the likelihood of a physician experiencing a\nmalpractice claim.5  Patient satisfaction with physi-\ncian communication is not, however, a straightfor-\nward issue.  For example, the expectations patients\nhave regarding their receipt of non-technical inter-\nventions such as education have been shown to affect\ntheir level of satisfaction with an encounter6 as do\ntheir perceptions of tension expressed by their physi-\ncian.7  Patient satisfaction appears to be enhanced\nwhen the patient and the physician have a similar\norientation regarding their respective roles during an\nencounter.8\nIn recent years particular interest has focused on\nexamining the closing moments of the encounter.\nFor example, studies have found that patients identify\nAshbury FD, Iverson DC, Kralj B.

Available from URL\nskills: Results of a survey of general/family practitioners in http://www.med-ed-online.org\nNewfoundland\n2\nnew problems in over 20% of the closing moments of\nan encounter, and physician interruptions occur in\nmore than one-third of these discussions.12,13  The\nimpact of these events on patients’ satisfaction with\nthe encounter is likely to be negative.  The well-\ndocumented problems that occur with doctor-patient\ncommunication14,15 are still a concern.  For example,\nLevinson and Chaumeton16 reported that patient en-\ncounters with surgeons in an ambulatory setting were\ncharacterized by discussions that had a narrow bio-\nmedical focus with little attention being paid to the\npsychological aspects of the patient’s problem, and\nby the surgeons talking more than the patients.  This\nis consistent with the findings of a study involving\npatient encounters with primary care physicians. In\nthis study patients were more satisfied with a visit\nwhen their physician had a communication pattern\nthat was dominated by psychosocial versus biomedi-\ncal issues.  Interestingly, physicians also expressed\ndissatisfaction when the communication pattern dur-\ning a patient encounter was dominated by biomedical\nissues.17  Similar findings were found in a study in-\nvolving outpatient cancer patients.  This study found\nthat physicians seldom focused their discussions on\npatients’ psychological concerns, used closed versus\nopen-ended questions, and provided patients few\nopportunities to initiate discussions important to\nthem.18  The lack of a focus on the patient’s agenda is\ndemonstrated in a study involving family physicians\nin which patients’ attempts to express their concerns\nto their physician were completed in only 28% of\nencounters, with the physician interrupting the patient\nwithin an average of 23 seconds from the start of the\nconversation.19  These concerns may be even more\nproblematic with elderly patients as evidenced by the\nresults of a study that found physicians were more\ninformative and supportive with younger patients,\nand were more condescending with elderly patients.20\nFinally, if there is poor interpersonal interaction or\ncommunication between the patient and physician\n(particularly the “usual source of care” physician) the\npatient is more likely to use the emergency depart-\nment rather than the usual source of care physician.\nThis will tend to increase system costs given that the\nemergency department is the most expensive/costly\ndelivery setting. For example, Weinkauf and Kralj\nshow that the average visit costs of providing care in\nthe ER are more than one-third higher than in the\noffice or walk-in clinic settings.21\nHowever, well-designed interventions can im-\nprove the communication skills of physicians,22,23 and\na number of initiatives directed at improving their\ncommunication skills have been initiated throughout\nCanada.24  It is probable that the effectiveness of\nthese and other educational efforts could be improved\nif we had a greater understanding of physicians’ atti-\ntudes towards various aspects of the doctor-patient\ncommunication, if we had an assessment of physi-\ncians’ confidence in using specific communication\nstrategies, and if we were more aware of what com-\nmunication strategies physicians routinely use in their\nencounters with patients and what their expectations\nof using these strategies were.  The purpose of this\nstudy was to expand and refine our knowledge with\nregard to these issues as they pertain to gen-\neral/family practitioners encounters with adult pa-\ntients.\nMethods\nA three-step process was used to develop the sur-\nvey instrument.  First, the published and grey litera-\nture was reviewed to identify the concepts that have\nbeen used to characterize physician communication\nskills as well as the methods used to assess these\nskills.25  The second step involved the conduct of\ninterviews and focus groups with practicing physi-\ncians with the intent of verifying the results of the\nliterature review and identifying additional concepts\nof effective patient communication.  An instrument\nwas then developed based on the identified concepts\nunderlying physician communication skills.  The\nthird step involved having the instrument reviewed\nby a panel of experts, and pre-testing it with 40 gen-\neral/family practitioners.\nThe resulting instrument included five sections:\ndemographics (e.g., number of patients seen in a\ntypical clinical day); confidence in using communi-\ncation strategies (e.g., How confident are you in your\nability to successfully identify and pursue verbal cues\ngiven by your patient?); time spent with patients\n(e.g., In your conversations with the adult patients\nyou saw last week, how often was the focus of your\nconversation on biomedical issues directly related to\nthe health problem?); use of communication strate-\ngies (e.g., In recalling the adult patients you saw last\nweek, in what percent of these patients did you ac-\ntively encourage them to express their feelings about\ntheir current problem?); and, closing the encounter\n(e.g., In recalling the adult patients you saw last\nweek, during the closing minutes of the encounter, in\nwhat percent of these patients did you summarize\nwhat had occurred during the encounter?).  \nGenerally, the respondents completed the ques-\ntions by selecting the response option that “most ac-\ncurately reflects” their answer to the question.  For\nexample, when asked to respond to the question,\n“How confident are you in your ability to success-\nAshbury FD, Iverson DC, Kralj B.

Respondents were also asked to estimate the\npercentage of their adult patients with whom the re-\nspondent used different communication strategies (if\napplicable).  Communication strategies were pre-\nsented to the respondents, and they were asked to\nrank their importance (among nine strategies from 1\nto 9, where 1 represented the most important in terms\nof patient outcomes and 9 the least important).\nThe Newfoundland and Labrador Medical Asso-\nciation (NLMA) reviewed the project and formally\nendorsed its implementation among practicing physi-\ncians in Newfoundland and Labrador.  A mailing list\nof all practicing physicians in Newfoundland and\nLabrador was obtained from the NLMA.  This list\nincluded 379 general/family practitioners.  In Janu-\nary, 2000, all the general/family practitioners on the\nlist were sent a survey package that included an in-\ntroductory letter on Health Canada letterhead that\nindicated the purpose of the survey and its endorse-\nment by the NLMA, the survey instrument and a\nstamped pre-addressed envelope in which to return\nthe completed survey.  The entire survey package\nwas re-sent to non-responders at four and seven\nweeks following the initial mailing.  Returned sur-\nveys were reviewed to determine the overall compl-\ntion rate. Surveys were excluded from analysis if\nfewer than 50% of the survey items were completed.\nThe survey responses were coded and entered into a\ndatabase.  To verify the quality of the data entry pro-\ncess, the actual responses for every 10th survey were\ncompared to the responses that had been entered into\nthe database.  This activity uncovered no errors in the\ndata entry process.  The survey data were then ana-\nlyzed using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS),\nversion 8.0 software.\nFindings\nWe received 160 completed survey  from gen-\neral/family practitioners yielding a response rate of\n42.2%.  However, since eight of the surveys were\nunable to be delivered by the mail service, the ad-\njusted response rate was 43.1%.  This rate is similar\nto rates reported in other studies involving physicians\nin Canada.26,27  The respondents were predominately\nestablished (in practice an average of 16.9 years)\nmale physicians (74.4%) who worked in busy prac-\ntices (seeing an average of 33.1 patients/day) that\nwere located in rural (51.3%) and urban/suburban\nareas (46.9%).\nWhile all respondents reported having received\nsome type of communications skills training, it was\njudged to be an insufficient amount of training at the\nundergraduate (50.0%) and residency (36.9%) levels\nas well as in the time since completion of their resi-\ndency (30.6%).  Irrespective of where the physician\nrespondents received their communications skills\ntraining, fewer than 20% judged it to be excellent.\nAs a measure of self-efficacy, respondents were\nasked to comment on their confidence to use various\ncommunication strategies during encounters with\nmost or the majority of their adult patients.  More\nthan half the respondents indicated they were confi-\ndent in and didn’t need to improve their use of two of\nthe 13 identified communication strategies (i.e., con-\nveying empathy—57.5% and explaining treatment\noptions—51.3%).  However, for eight of the 13\ncommunication strategies a majority of the respon-\ndents indicated they believed they needed to improve\ntheir use of the strategy.\nRespondents identified communication strategies\nthey felt they most needed to improve.  The commu-\nnication strategies they wanted to improve were:\ncommunicating effectively with difficult patients\n(83.7%); securing patient commitment to follow the\ntreatment plan (76.9%); discussing alternative or\ncomplementary therapies (75.7%); identifying and\nursuing non-verbal patient cues (73.2%); and, iden-\ntifying and pursuing verbal patient cues (68.1%).\nInterestingly, among these communication strategies\nphysicians differed in their confidence in using the\nstrategy.  For example, while 75.7% of respondents\nindicated they needed to improve their ability to dis-\ncuss alternative or complementary strategies with\ntheir patients, 44.4% expressed confidence in their\ncurrent abilities to use the strategy while 31.3% indi-\ncated they were not very confident (Table 1).  Fi-\nnally, the vast majority (83.8%) of respondents indi-\ncated that their communication skills were as impo-\ntant as their technical skills in terms of achieving\ndesirable patient outcomes.\nWhile most of the physicians (63.1%) reported\nth y had been able to spend the required amount of\ntime with the patients they saw during the prior week,\n23.8% indicated the time spent with their patients\nwa  insufficient.  Almost two-thirds of the physicians\n(62.5%) stated that most of the time spent with their\nAshbury FD, Iverson DC, Kralj B. Physician communication Med Educ Online [serial online] 2001;6:1. Available from URL\nskills: Results of a survey of general/family practitioners in http://www.med-ed-online.org\nNewfoundland\n4\npatients was devoted to discussions of biomedical\nissues.  Discussion of psychosocial issues was most\nlikely to consume some of the time (67.5%) or a little\nof the time (13.8%) during a typical patient encoun-\nter.\nPhysicians were asked to estimate the frequency\nwith which they used specific communication strate-\ngies with the adult patients they saw in the previous\nweek (Table 2).  While all of the strategies were r-\nported as having been used with the patients they saw\nduring the prior week, a majority of the physicians\nindicated they used 11 of the 13 strategies with more\nthan 60% of their patients.  The strategies they most\nfrequently used were: addressing patients in a polite,\nwarm friendly manner (92.6%); addressing patient\nquestions at the appropriate level of detail (84.4%);\nresponding to patients who express their feelings in a\nsupportive manner (81.9%); and educating patients\nabout treatment options and checking for their under-\nstanding (76.3%).  The two strategies physicians did\nnot use in more than 60% of their patient encounters\nwere: actively encouraging patients to express their\nfeelings about their problem (57.6%), and determin-\ning the psychological, emotional and social needs of\ntheir patients (52.5%).  It is interesting to note that\nwhile the respondents indicated that all of the com-\nmunication strategies contributed significantly to\npositive patient outcomes, the contribution of these\nstrategies to outcomes was greater for new versus\nestablished patients.  For example, respondents indi-\ncated that actively expressing understanding and em-\npathy for their patients’ problems significantly con-\ntributed to positive patient outcomes more frequently\nwith new (91.3%) than with established (79.4%) pa-\ntients.\nPhysicians were also asked to estimate the fre-\nquency with which they used nine specific communi-\ncation strategies during the closing minutes of their\npatient encounters during the previous week (Table\n3).  Only three of the communication strategies were\nused by a majority of the physicians with more than\n60% of their patients: reviewing the treatment plan\nwith patients (59.4%); encouraging patients to follow\nthe plan and reassuring them that it should help to\nresolve the problem (57.5%); and, informing patients\nwhat to expect as the condition gets worse or better\n(50%).  The physicians were also asked to rank the\nnine communication strategies in terms of their con-\ntribution to a positive patient outcome.  The strategies\nranked as being most important were: summarizing\nwhat occurred during the encounter; asking patients if\nthey understand the nature of the problem and the\ncomponents of the treatment plan; and reviewing the\ntreatment plan.  The strategies ranked as being least\nmportant were: referring patients to support services;\nexpressing concern for patients’ resolution of their\nproblems; and informing patients the encounter is\nending.\nDiscussion\nThe results of this survey are instructive regarding\nthe need for and desired direction of physician com-\nmunication initiatives.  The physician respondents\ngenerally rated their prior communication skills\ntraining as being insufficient in quantity and only\nacc ptable to poor in quality.  They also indicated a\nneed to improve their use of eight of the 13 commu-\nn cation strategies that were identified on the survey.\nThus, for example, the respondents indicated a need\nto improve their ability to identify non-verbal patient\ncues, to discuss alternative and complementary thera-\npie  with patients, to address their patients’ psycho-\nsocial needs, and to secure a commitment from pa-\ntients to try to adhere to the agreed-upon treatment\nplan.  This suggests that these primary care physi-\ncians are at a stage of readiness where they are likely\nto respond to initiatives to help them expand and im-\nprove their communication skills.  What is crucial,\nerefore, is to ensure that the communication skills\ninitiatives that are offered to primary care physicians\nare designed in accord with what has been shown to\nbe effective.  The importance of this point is illus-\ntrated in a review of 14 studies on communication\nskills training for nurses in which it was concluded\nthat communications training had limited or no ef-\nfects on nurses’ communication skills as well as on\ntheir use of these skills in a working environment.28\nWell-designed communications skills training\nsessions for physicians, however, have been shown to\nhave a significant impact on their acquisition of\ncommunication skills, on refinement of their existing\nskills, and on their patterns of using these skills in\nclinical settings.  For example, a one-day interactive\ntraining program offered to physicians in a health\nmaintenance organization was effective in increasing\nrticipants’ confidence in their ability to use specific\ncommunication skills as well as their self-reported\nuse of communication skills at a three-month follow-\nup.  This training program focused on specific strat-\ngies to use during the medical interview, on strategies\nus ful for brief encounters, and on managing difficult\npatient interactions.29  A shorter communications\ntraining program (i.e., 4½ hours) was also able to\ndemonstrate changes in physicians’ acquisition and\nsubsequent use of specific communication skills.  A\ncommunications training program directed at primary\ncar  residents was effective in altering the structure\nof the consultation, in increasing the use of a patient-\nAshbury FD, Iverson DC, Kralj B.

This training differs from\nothers in that it involved short training sessions (to-\ntaling 22½ hours) distributed over a six-month pe-\nriod.31  Even brief workshops (i.e., four hours) that\naddress topics as sensitive as how to deliver bad news\nand how to deal with difficult situations in the prac-\ntice of oncology have been shown to result in an in-\ncrease in the acquisition of communications skills\nand participants’ self-reported confidence in using\nthem during clinical encounters.32  Two characteris-\ntics seem to be associated with successful communi-\ncations skills training programs: they are interactive\nin nature and they focus on specific communications\nskills.  Even though interactive learning is a basic\ntenet of adult learning, its application in physician\ntraining programs, especially CME programs, is far\nfrom being universal.  The selection of which com-\nmunication skills to focus on during a training ses-\nsion should be based on the self-assessed or demon-\nstrated needs of the participants.  Guidance in the\nselection of which specific communication skills are\nmost important comes from Roter, who has identified\nfive conceptual groupings of physician-patient com-\nmunications skills: information-giving, question-\nasking, partnership-building, rapport-building, and\nsocio-emotional talk.33  Any one of these categories\ncould be the focus of a communications training ini-\ntiative.  The results of our study and others suggest\ncertain foci of communications training may be espe-\ncially important at this time.  For example, the find-\nings by Marvel and associates34 that patients are in-\nterrupted, on average, 23 seconds after initiating the\nconversation, and only 28% of their concerns were\nfully expressed to their physician, strongly suggest\nthe need for a focus on active listening skills.  If phy-\nsicians are not good listeners, it is unlikely that they\nwill be good communicators.\nGiven that the time spent with patients appears to\nbe decreasing, the need for physicians to learn how to\nbe effective listeners increases in importance.  Our\nresults indicate that physicians did not routinely en-\ncourage their patients to express their feelings about\ntheir problems, and did not routinely determine the\npsychological, emotional and social needs of their\npatients.  Addressing these topics often requires more\ntime than addressing biomedical topics and is very\nmuch dependent upon the physician’s active listening\nskills.  The development of these skills should be a\npriority within most communications training pro-\ngrams, as should training in how to address psycho-\nsocial issues in an efficient and effective manner.\nOur results also indicate a need to focus training on\nincreasing physicians’ confide ce (i.e., personal self-\nefficacy) in their use of specific communications\nskills.  Bandura defines the concept of self-efficacy\nas a person’s assessment of her/his ability to take an\naction.35  A person must perceive herself or himself\nto be capable of taking the desired action in order to\ninitiate the sequence of steps required to bring that\naction about.36  With regard to physicians, this can\nbest be done with interactive training sessions com-\nbined with feedback from actual patient encounters.\nThis could involve videotaping patient encounters,\nuse of simulated patients, patient questionnaires or a\ncombination of the above.37,38\nFinally our data suggest that the closing moments\nf the encounter represent a special training opportu-\nn ty.  Physicians report using only a few communica-\ntion strategies during the closing moments and do not\nroutinely use two strategies that they rated as being of\nhigh importance—i.e., summarizing what occurred\nduring the encounter, and asking patients if they un-\nderstand the nature of their problem and the compo-\nnents of their treatment plan.\nWhile it is encouraging that interest in communi-\ncations skills training for physicians is increasing in\nNorth America, it is sobering to note how far we ap-\npear to be lagging behind the United Kingdom.  In\nthe UK a national effort was initiated in the early\n1990s to develop a strategy to assess the interper-\nsonal skills of general practitioners against a set of\nclearly defined performance criteria (e.g., the doctor\nencourages the patient’s contribution at appropriate\npoints in the consultation).  To receive a post gradu-\na e qualification in family medicine physicians must\nsubmit 15 videotaped consultations for review by\ntrained video examiners, and attain a passing mark.39\nIdeally, communications skills training will attain a\nsimilar level of importance in North America at the\nundergraduate, graduate and post-graduate training\nlevels by the end of the first decade of this new cen-\ntury.\nThe findings and observations of this study must\nbe interpreted in light of its limitations.  The attitudi-\nnal, self-efficacy and behavioral communications\nskills data are self-reported by respondents.  This is\nthe most appropriate method for collecting the attitu-\ndinal and self-efficacy data, but an observational\nmethod is a more rigorous procedure for collecting\ndata on actual use of communication strategies.  It\nseems reasonable to assume the behavioral data ove-\nestimate the actual use of the communication strate-\ngies.  In addition, while the response rate is similar to\nthat reported in other studies involving physicians, it\nis still less than ideal.  This concern is somewhat off-\nset by the fact that the survey was population-based,\ninvolving all family physicians/general practitioners\nAshbury FD, Iverson DC, Kralj B.

Finally, since we do not know\nhow respondents differ from non-respondents, it\nseems reasonable to assume that the respondents are\nmore interested in the topic of physician-patient i\nteractions.\nConclusion\nPhysician-patient communications skills are inte-\ngral to patient satisfaction, optimal use of time during\nthe patient-provider encounter, patient participation\nin treatment decision-making, adherence to the treat-\nment plan, and positive patient outcomes.  Physicians\nrecognize the importance of good communication\nskills, but require training to ensure effective deliv-\nery.  There is an urgent need for coordinated ap-\nproaches to facilitate communication skills training at\nthe undergraduate, residency and post-graduate lev-\nels.\nReferences\n1.

Can it Feel Pride or Shame in Company?\n-- Questions of the Nature of Human Vitality\nColwyn Trevarthen,\nDepartment of Psychology\nThe University of Edinburg\nShorter Oxford English Dictionary, Third Revised\nEdition, 1969\nRobot: Czeck, from robotiti, to work, drudge.\nRelated to German arbeit.\na) A living being that acts automatically (without\nvolition).\nb) A machine devised to function in place of a\nliving agent; one which acts automatically or with\na minimum of external impulse.\nRobots É persons all of whose activities were\nimposed upon them and who were not allowed\nÔeven the luxury of original sinÕ. -- G. B. Shaw.\nRobotize: To mechanicalize.\n\"The doctrine which I am maintaining is that the\nwhole concept of materialism only applies to very\nabstract entities, the products of logical\ndiscernment. The concrete enduring entities are\norganisms, so that the plan of the whole influences\nthe very characters of the various subordinate\norganisms which enter into it. In the case of an\nanimal, the mental states enter into the plan of the\ntotal organism and thus modify the plans of\nsuccessive subordinate organisms until the ultimate\nsmallest organism, such as electrons, are reached.\nThere are thus two sides to the machinery involved\nin the development of nature. On the one side there\nis a given environment with organisms adapting\nthemselves to it ... The other side of the evolutionary\nmachinery, the neglected side, is expressed by the\nword creativeness. The organisms can create their\nown environment. For this purpose the single\norganism is almost helpless. The adequate forces\nrequire societies of cooperating organisms. But with\nsuch cooperation and in proportion to the effort put\nforward, the environment has a plasticity which\nalters the whole ethical aspect of evolution.\"\n(A. N. Whitehead, Science and the Modern World,\n1925)\nIntroduction and Summary\nI give the OED definition of a robot to emphasise that\nit is the lack of volition that distinguishes and robotic\nÔworkerÕ, which by this criterion is a mere tool. I\nreproduce a favourite quotation from Whitehead for the\nclever and illuminating way it distinguished between\nabstractions, Ôproducts of logical discernmentÕ, and\norganisms that have a special coherence and\nÔorganisationÕ, out of which properties ÔemergeÕ that are\nboth adaptable and creative. I do not accept that\nsimulation of the appearances or the motions and\neffects of life, however intricate and ingenious, is a\nmaking of life. Organisms are complex dynamic\nsystems (CDSs) of a strange kind, always active within\nenvelopes that limit and constrain what emerges, and\nthat separate and aggregate sub-CDSs in intricate\nhierarchies, in such a way that what ÔemergesÕ is fated\nto adaptive ends. It is the ÔfinalityÕ that is the secret of\nthe creativity of a living being, not its ÔplasticityÕ.\nEvery living thing has a system or programme of\ndevelopment, the course of which is both genetically\nand epigenetically determined from each zygotic\nbeginning. There is never less than one bounded,\ncomplex and organised, actively self-sustaining cell,\nwith an intricate Ôimport-export, customs controlÕ of a\nmulti-layered molecular cell wall, a cytoplasm full of\nenergy-storing and metabolism and gene expression\ncontrolling organellae, and a nucleus with genetic\nmaterial, also bounded by an ÔeditorialÕ wall. And what\nhappens when this cell changes, divides, differentiates\nand re-integrates by a determined auto-poesis depends\non the whole structure of that initial organism-cell. The\ngenes it inherits are just part of the play, with\nconstrained roles and responses, obedient to the\nmessages from the cell surface and its systems of\ncytoplasmic organellae.\nPlants grow their life in species-specific form,\nmaking substance by draining nutriment and moisture\nfrom the earth and capturing energy from the sun, with\nchloroplasts that react to light by assuming the green\ncolour that will capture light energy effectively. Plants\nsocialise by hiding in one anotherÕs shade, by climbing or\nperching on one another, by joining in canopy layers to meet\nlight and withstand storms, by poisoning one anotherÕs\ngrowth if the competition is intense. Some branches become\nleaves that grow across the life-giving light and against\ngravitation, channelling off excessive water to the roots;\nothers aggregate into flowers that seduce insects or birds and\nmake sugary fruits, coloured to signal ripeness, that birds or\nmammals eat to carry off seeds, or dry seeds that are lifted\naway by wind or water. The ÔpurposefulnessÕ of their growth\nforms is obvious, and well-defended to exploit the vagaries\nof the physical ÔcontextÕ, relying on the sufficient\nconsistencies of the matter and energy around them.\nAnimals move to live. Their bodies are formed to allow\nintricately timed pulses of muscular energy in harmonious\ncomplexes of plastic transformation that push against the\nenvironment, to drive displacements of the whole body in\nthe gravitational field -- through water or on air, by stepping\nover solid surfaces or by climbing in 3-D mazes. Every\nanimal embryo has genetic symmetry and polarity that\ndefines a locomotive self, and in the process the\nÔprefunctional morphogenesisÕ, anatomy elaborated before\nany muscle moves, specifies a mobile future and maps out\nthe principle of a geographical territory for action. Time and\nspace made in the body become the condition and context\nfor the individual animalÕs activity, as well as for the social\nlife and ecological specialisation of the family and social\ngroup.\nAnimal bodies have muscles that can attack things in the\nenvironment (including other animals or plants) to\nassimilate nourishment, as well as muscles that distribute\nvital fluids, gases and chemical products around the organs\ninside their bodies. Brains give the muscle masses and\nskeletal mechanisms unified purpose and calculate the future\neconomy of effort. The socially sophisticated forms grow\nextra muscles and neural motor nuclei that elaborate states of\ninner self-regulation into signals of motivation — of interest,\nintended effort, investigative strategy and state of well-\nbeing. Eventually, in response to socially aware others, these\nself-revealing expressions become social-devices regulating\ncompanionship with selected others. Signals of the visible\nsurface of mobile bodies, or thrown from the interior of the\nbody by vocal or chemical means, condition and guide\naffective relationships, giving rise to the ÔethicalÕ\nimplications Whiting referred to — of affiliation, enmity,\nloyalty and betrayal.\nI will outline what we know of the early life of a human\nindividual to demonstrate how far from robotic we are\nalready, when innocent of language or Ôlogical discernmentÕ,\nwhy we cannot possibly, ever, live as robots, and why I am\nsure robots will never live as we do. I believe that the idea\nof simulating psychology with computational machines is\nthinkable for our culture only because of a tautology. We\nhave created a mechanistic cognitive psychology that forgets,\nor misrepresents, the natural intentionality and emotionality\nthat makes cognition useful. In consequence of this\nreduction of our particular cultural view of mentality, our\npsychology hasnÕt a clue about the nature of our emotional\nconcerns, either in our relations of collaborative\ncompanionship together, or as we may find ourselves when\nalone with our conscience. Just as the ancients were inspired\nand befuddled by beliefs in wild, seductive, vicious,\npleasure-loving spirits and gods, we are confused by\nnotions of ourselves as mechanisms.\nFirst the nature of animal motives needs clarifying,\nbecause muscular action, with its prospective guidance\nby intelligent perception and learning, has peculiar\nfeatures of rhythm and grace that machines may never\nreproduce, except by slavish copying of effects without\ncause. Mathematical analysis of the dynamics of\nmovement in animals, all animals, appears to reveal\nconservation of principles of prospective control in\ntime and space that are unique in the universe. The\nsame principles have been found in the activity of large\npopulations of neurons in the motor cortex, and\nelsewhere in the brain, some moments before a given\nmovement is exercised. This kind of collective nerve\nactivity is also indicative of a capacity to imitate or\n’mirror’ agency, enabling one animal to take up the\nmotives of another, and execute a matching act. The\nsociety of animals is possible because the minds that\nmotivate animal bodies have evolved ways of detecting\nand engaging with the purposes and concerns of other\nembodied and animated minds. The ’motor images’\nthat make vital action coherent, efficient and purposeful\nin relation to the world can be exchanged between\nindividuals and elaborated cooperatively.\nThen, we have to think about how an infant comes\nabout as a trapped and parasitic embryo and foetus,\nhow it is prepared for free living before entering the\nuniquely emotional epigenetic world of human society.\nIn the earliest stages of a form that will have an\nelongated locomotile body, the body is mapped with\npolarity, dorso-ventral asymmetry, and bilateral\nsymmetry, and this same map is impregnated in a\nprototype CNS while it is still a sheet of\nundifferentiated cells interconnected by tight junctions.\nThere is a somatic rind to the body, destined to be\nmuscular and furnished with sense organs, and internal\nviscera adapted to internal metabolic and reproductive\nconcerns, and the embryo CNS maps these regions,\ntoo. In the late embryo (the second month of human\ngestation) the first cell aggregates and axons of a neural\nnet appear in the core of the brain and spinal chord as\nthe head is elaborated with potentialities for forward\nlooking special exteroceptors, but at this stage there is\nno movement and no sensation. When the first motor\naxons grow to the muscles, and even when the first\nmovements occur, there is no sensory input to the\nbrain to advise on how circuits should form. The first\nelaborated systems are the core motivating ones, and\nthose later to be identified with the neurohumoral\nsystems of emotion. The emotional mechanisms serve\nas morphogenesis regulators of the neocortex, which is\nin a rudimentary condition, just sheets of neuroblasts,\nwell into the foetal stage. Indeed the emotional and\ncommunicative mechanisms serve as controllers of the\ncognitive machinery of the cortex at all subsequent\nstages of development. Those attempting robotic\nmodelling should remember this. Emotions, generated\nand regulated in the brain stem first, are causal in both\nmind development and mind functioning, not just self-\nregulatory responses or outputs. The whole process has\nan astonishing plannedness or what Sherrington,\nspeaking of the integrative action of the nervous system and\nconsciousness, called ’projiscience’.\nFinally we will see how an infant, with its already\ncomplex and yet rapidly developing brain, moves to find\ncompanions, and to engage with and learn about the\nresources and risks of the physical but mentally transformed\nworld that may be shared -- how he or she gains an\nindividuality in the family and an active understanding of\nsociety, learning a culturally extended consciousness of the\nnarrative of being in the history of a community, its\nacquired beliefs, knowledge, skills and language. We know a\ngreat deal now about how an infant becomes interested in the\nmeanings by which other persons live their life, in the\nculture that patterns the collective consciousness of the\nsociety into which the baby has been born. Through the first\nyear an infant first seeks care and comfort, and also engages\nin rhythmic ’protoconversational’ transactions with familiar\nand trusted others. In early weeks they play together,\nlearning routines of joking and teasing, consolidating trust\nwith affection.\nIt is this stage that exhibits the most wonderful\n’musicality’ of human moving -- the intricate rhythms and\nphrasing, the subtle variations of expression in tone and\nmelody, and the development of narrative forms that guide\nexcitement and promise repetition of climactic moments and\ncalming resolution. From birth, infants are sensitive to the\nmoods and time patterns of music. Why? Because the\nhuman body is inherently polyrhythmic and melaodic in its\nexpression. The human body is built for the kind of grace\nand power one finds in cultivated music and in dance or\nsport. No other mammal, though all have intentional grace,\nhas such versatility of motor expression. This is the secret of\nour story-making consciousness and our capacity to invent\npowerful the ever changing tangible and intangible works of\nculture.\nThe infant senses effects of moving in his or her body,\nand engages with objects that passively receive actions of\nexploration and manipulative investigation. And then, just\nbefore the end of the first year, actively searches the sights\nand sounds of a partner’s actions to share their purposes. The\none-year-old is intentionally cooperative, willing and eager\nto take up the interests and actions of others as meaningful.\nThis is the unique motivation of the human that inevitably\nleads to mastery of the symbols of language and every other\nkind of cultural invention. The infant’s personal identity\nbecomes a reflection of what others seek in him or her for\ncompany, and for aharing meaning.\nI will illustrate steps in the argument with evidence that\nI am not inventing an abstract theory of mind and human\nconscious thinking, but attempting to describe the natural,\nbut miraculous, vitality of human minds from their\nbeginnings.\nReferences\nAitken, K.

INTRODUCTION\nThe primary purpose of this paper is to give a clear definition of intu-\nitive set theory (IST), so that researchers have all the necessary back-\nground to investigate the consistency of the two axioms that define IST\n[1, 2, 4]. Go¨del tells us that even though we are not in a position to\nprove the consistency of a significant theory, we can prove its incon-\nsistency, if it is inconsistent. The secondary purpose of this paper is\nto explain IST to the novice who has a passing acquaintance with the\ntransfinite cardinals of Cantor.\nHome Page\nTitle Page\nContents\nJJ II\nJ I\nPage 3 of 26\nGo Back\nFull Screen\nClose\nQuit\n2. SEQUENCES AND SETS\nWe will accept the fact that every number in the open interval (0, 1)\ncan be represented uniquely by an infinite nonterminating binary se-\nquence.\nFor example, the infinite binary sequence\n.10101010 · · ·\ncan be recognized as the representation for the number 2/3 and\n.10111111 · · ·\nfor the number 3/4. This in turn implies that an infinite subset of\npositive integers can be used to represent the numbers in the interval\n(0, 1). Thus we have the set\n{1, 3, 5, 7, · · · }+\nalso as a representation for 2/3. A binary sequence that goes towards\nthe right as above, we will call a right-sequence and the corresponding\nHome Page\nTitle Page\nContents\nJJ II\nJ I\nPage 4 of 26\nGo Back\nFull Screen\nClose\nQuit\nset a right-set, to make provision for a left-sequence and a left-set. It\nis easy to see that the left sequence\n· · · 000010011.\nand the corresponding left-set\n−{4, 1, 0}\ncan be used to represent the number 19. In general, any nonnegative\ninteger can be represented by a left-sequence, which eventually ends\nup in 0s. Two’s complement number system allows us to use left-\nsequences which eventually end up in 1s to represent negative integers.\nThus, we have the left-sequence,\n· · · 111100101.\nand the left-set\n−{· · · 8, 7, 6, 5, 2, 0}\nHome Page\nTitle Page\nContents\nJJ II\nJ I\nPage 5 of 26\nGo Back\nFull Screen\nClose\nQuit\nrepresenting the negative number −27. Adding up all these facts, we\ncan claim that a two-way sequence can be used to represent any num-\nber on a real line. For example, the sequence,\n· · · 000010011.10101010 · · ·\nand the corresponding two-way set\n−{4, 1, 0 : 1, 3, 5, 7 · · · }+\nrepresent the number 19.6666 · · · . Similarly, the complement of this\nsequence,\n· · · 111101100.01010101 · · ·\nand the corresponding two-way set\n−{· · · 8, 7, 6, 5, 3, 2 : 2, 4, 6, 8 · · · }+\nrepresent the negative number −19.6666 · · · . Note the restriction in\nour definition of a real number: the left sequence must eventually end\nup in either 1s or 0s. The number system we get when we put no\nHome Page\nTitle Page\nContents\nJJ II\nJ I\nPage 6 of 26\nGo Back\nFull Screen\nClose\nQuit\nrestriction on both the left-sequence and the right-sequence, we will\ncall the universal number system (UNS). A universal number, whose\nleft sequence is not eventually-periodic, we will call a supernatural\nnumber. The connection between the transcendental and supernatural\nnumbers is explained next.\nHome Page\nTitle Page\nContents\nJJ II\nJ I\nPage 7 of 26\nGo Back\nFull Screen\nClose\nQuit\n3. UNIVERSAL NUMBER SYSTEM\nWe will first explain why we have excepted eventually-periodic left-\nsequences from our definition of supernatural numbers. Consider the\nleft-sequence\n· · · 101101101001001.\nwith a periodic part a = 101 = 5 of length lp = 3 and a nonperiodic\npart b = 001001 = 9 of length ln = 6. We can write the sequence\nformally as\nb+\na2ln\n1− 2lp\nwhich when evaluated gives\n−257\n7\n.\nFrom this we infer that eventually-periodic left-sequences corresponds\nto negative rational numbers. A similar argument shows that eventually-\nperiodic right-sequences represent positive rational numbers.\nHome Page\nTitle Page\nContents\nJJ II\nJ I\nPage 8 of 26\nGo Back\nFull Screen\nClose\nQuit\nWe want to show that corresponding to every transcendental num-\nber there is a supernatural number. Given a universal number a, the\nnumber we get when we flip the two-way infinite string around the\nbinary point, we will write as aF . Consider the transcendental number\npi\n4\n= · · · 000.11001000110 · · ·\nand (pi\n4\n)F\n= · · · 01100010011.000 · · ·\nwhich gives the appearance of a number above all natural numbers.\nIt is for this reason, we have called it a supernatural number, but of\ncourse, it is no more supernatural than the transcendental number is\ntranscendental. From this example, we infer that corresponding to ev-\nery transcendental number in the interval (0, 1), there is a supernatural\nnumber. More generally, we can say that every irrational number in\nthe interval (0, 1) has a corresponding supernatural number. By def-\ninition, an infinite recursive subset of positive integers, is an infinite\nHome Page\nTitle Page\nContents\nJJ II\nJ I\nPage 9 of 26\nGo Back\nFull Screen\nClose\nQuit\nright-set with a clear algorithm for its generation. The correspond-\ning number in the interval (0, 1) is called a computable number. It is\nknown from recursive function theory that the cardinality of the set R\nof these computable numbers is ℵ0. A number in the interval (0, 1),\nwhich is not computable, we will call an illusive number. We will have\nmore to say about irrational computable numbers, but before that we\nwant to take a cursory look at the transfinite cardinals of Cantor.\nHome Page\nTitle Page\nContents\nJJ II\nJ I\nPage 10 of 26\nGo Back\nFull Screen\nClose\nQuit\n4. TRANSFINITE CARDINALS\nRecall that every natural number can be represented by a set as\ngiven below.\n{} = 0,\n{0} = 1,\n{0, 1} = 2,\n{0, 1, 2} = 3,\n.\n.\n.\nThe advantage with this method is that we get an elegant way of defin-\ning the first transfinite cardinal of Cantor, as\nℵ0 = {0, 1, 2, 3, · · · }.\nHome Page\nTitle Page\nContents\nJJ II\nJ I\nPage 11 of 26\nGo Back\nFull Screen\nClose\nQuit\nThe set of all subsets of a set S is called the powerset of S, and written\nas 2S . Cantor has shown (diagonal procedure) that the powerset of S\nwill always have greater cardinality than the set S, even when S is an\ninfinite set. An important consequence of this is that we can without\nend construct bigger and bigger sets,\n2ℵ0 , 22\nℵ0\n, 22\n2ℵ0\n, · · ·\nand hence in set theory we cannot have a set which has the highest\ncardinality. A disappointing consequence is that we cannot have a\nuniversal collection as part of set theory and such a collection will\nalways have to be outside the set theory. One-to-one correspondence\nis the basis on which cardinality is decided, from which it follows that\nℵ0 can also be written as\n{1, 2, 4, 8, · · · } = {20, 21, 22, 23, · · · }.\nAs Halmos points out [3], there is confusion in the literature regarding\nthe notation 2ω, it has been used to represent the above set and also\nHome Page\nTitle Page\nContents\nJJ II\nJ I\nPage 12 of 26\nGo Back\nFull Screen\nClose\nQuit\nthe set 2ℵ0 , which in extenso, can be written as\n2{0,1,2,3,···}.\nTo prevent this confusion, whenever necessary, we will write 2ℵ0 as\n{< 20, 21, 22, 23, · · · >}\nto imply that 2ℵ0 is a derived set from\n{20, 21, 22, 23, · · · }.\nHome Page\nTitle Page\nContents\nJJ II\nJ I\nPage 13 of 26\nGo Back\nFull Screen\nClose\nQuit\n5. INFINITESIMALS\nThe study of the set of natural numbers gave us the notion of ℵ0.\nThe concept of a powerset makes it clear that there are higher cardinals\nabove ℵ0. Then the question arises, whether there is some other way\nof generating larger cardinals, other than taking powersets. Cantor has\nshown that this is possible, and gives us the sequence of transfinite sets\nof increasing cardinality as\nℵ0,ℵ1,ℵ2,ℵ3, · · · ,\nwith the understanding that there is no cardinal between ℵα and ℵα+1.\nHow exactly this sequence was generated, is an issue that we will take\nup later, but for the moment we will accept this sequence.\nBecause of the one-to-one correspondence between the right-sets\nand the left-sets, we will concentrate our attention on just the right-sets\nand right-sequences. Note, as an example, that the infinite sequence\n.110 ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ · · · can be used to represent the interval (.75, .875), if we\naccept certain assumptions about the representation:\nHome Page\nTitle Page\nContents\nJJ II\nJ I\nPage 14 of 26\nGo Back\nFull Screen\nClose\nQuit\nThe initial binary string, .110 = .75, represents the\ninitial point of the interval.\nThe length of the binary string, 3 in our case, decides\nthe length of the interval as 2−3 = .125.\nEvery ∗ in the infinite ∗-string can be substituted by a\n0 or 1, to create 2ℵα points in the interval.\nNow, consider the right-sequence\n.10101010 · · · ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ · · ·\nand the corresponding right-set\n{1, 3, 5, 7, · · · ℵ0, · · · ℵα}+.\nIf we can attach a meaning to this right-sequence, it can be only this:\nit represents the number .6666 · · · with an infinitesimal attached to it,\nthe cardinality of the set of points inside the infinitesimal being 2ℵα .\nHome Page\nTitle Page\nContents\nJJ II\nJ I\nPage 15 of 26\nGo Back\nFull Screen\nClose\nQuit\n6. AXIOM OF FUSION\nThe upshot of all our discussion so far is the following: The unit\ninterval (0, 1) is a set of infinitesimals with cardinality ℵ0, with each\ninfinitesimal representing a computable number. From the method we\nused in the construction of the infinitesimal, it will not be unreason-\nable, if we claim that the infinitesimal is an integral unit from which\nnone of its 2ℵα elements can be removed. A set from which, the axiom\nof choice (AC) cannot remove an element, we will call a bonded set\nand the elements in it figments. If a set contains only bonded sets as\nits elements, then we will call it a class of bonded sets or just bonded\nclass. We will use the term virtual cardinality to refer to the cardinal-\nity of a bonded class. The set of all subsets of ℵα of cardinality ℵα\nwe will symbolize as\n(ℵα\nℵα\n)\n. Our saying so, will not, of course, make\nanything a fact, so we introduce an axiom called fusion.\nAxiom of Fusion. (0, 1) =\n(ℵα\nℵα\n)\n= R × 2ℵα , where x × 2ℵα is a\nbonded set.\nHome Page\nTitle Page\nContents\nJJ II\nJ I\nPage 16 of 26\nGo Back\nFull Screen\nClose\nQuit\nThe axiom of fusion says that (0, 1) is a class of bonded sets, called\ninfinitesimals. Further, the cardinality of each infinitesimal is 2ℵα , and\nthe virtual cardinality of (0, 1) is ℵ0.\nCombinatorial Theorem.\n(ℵα\nℵα\n)\n= 2ℵα .\nProof. A direct consequence of the axiom of fusion is that\n2ℵα ≤\n(ℵα\nℵα\n)\n.\nSince,\n(ℵα\nℵα\n)\nis a subset of 2ℵα ,(ℵα\nℵα\n)\n≤ 2ℵα ,\nand the theorem follows. \u0003\nHome Page\nTitle Page\nContents\nJJ II\nJ I\nPage 17 of 26\nGo Back\nFull Screen\nClose\nQuit\n7.

AXIOM OF MONOTONICITY\nStripped of all verbal explanations, we can write the generation of\nω1 as\n< 0, 1, 2, · · ·ω, · · ·ω2, · · ·ωω, · · · ωω, · · · , · · · , · · · >\nor in terms of the explosive operators as\n< 0, 1, 2, · · ·ω, · · ·ω ⊗0 ω, · · ·ω ⊗1 ω, · · ·ω ⊗2 ω, · · · , · · · , · · · > .\nCantor has shown that the cardinality of ω ⊗k ω is ℵ0 for all finite\nvalues of k, and hence it is not that we have a sequence here of in-\ncreasing cardinality. Taking into account this fact, we assert that what\nthe sequence means is that\nℵ1 = {< 0, 1, 2, · · ·ω, · · ·ω ⊗0 ω, · · ·ω ⊗1 ω, · · ·ω ⊗2 ω, · · · >}\n= ℵ0 ⊗{0,1,2,··· } ℵ0\n= ℵ0 ⊗ℵ0 ℵ0.\nHome Page\nTitle Page\nContents\nJJ II\nJ I\nPage 21 of 26\nGo Back\nFull Screen\nClose\nQuit\nOnce this is accepted, a natural extension is that\nℵα+1 = ℵα ⊗ℵ0 ℵα.\nAn inspection of the explosive operators shows that m⊗kn is a mono-\ntonically increasing function of m, k, and n. Hence it will not be un-\nreasonable to expect m ⊗k n to remain at least monotonically non-\ndecreasing, when m, k, and n assume tranfinite cardinal values. Our\nsaying all this, will not make it a fact, for that reason we state an axiom\ncalled axiom of monotonicity. Cantor always wanted his Continuum\nHypothesis, 2ℵ0 = ℵ1, to be true in his set theory. We now introduce\nan axiom that accomplishes this, and even more.\nAxiom of Monotonicity. ℵα+1 = ℵα ⊗ℵ0 ℵα, and 2ℵα = 2 ⊗1 ℵα.\nFurther, if m1 ≤ m2, k1 ≤ k2, and n1 ≤ n2, then m1 ⊗k1 n1 ≤\nm2 ⊗k2 n2.\nContinuum Theorem. ℵα+1 = m⊗k ℵα for finite m > 1, k > 0.\nHome Page\nTitle Page\nContents\nJJ II\nJ I\nPage 22 of 26\nGo Back\nFull Screen\nClose\nQuit\nProof.

CONCLUSION\nA new concept that we have introduced in IST is that of a bonded\nset containing figments. It is somewhat like the concept of quarks in\nparticle physics, where we know that they are there, but we cannot get\none of them isolated. Figments can be very helpful in visualizing the\nspace around us. If we call an infinitesimal with figments in it a white\nhole, we can say that the finite part of our physical space is nothing but\na tightly packed set of white holes. Since every irrational number has\nan infinitesimal attached with it, we can claim that every supernatural\nnumber has a black stretch attached with it and the physical space\nbeyond the finite part is a black whole containing black stretches in it.\nIST visualizes an infinite recursive subset of positive integers as a\nnumber in the interval (0, 1), with a corresponding infinitesimal. This\ninfinitesimal has in it all the transfinite sets containing the original\nrecursive set.\nHome Page\nTitle Page\nContents\nJJ II\nJ I\nPage 25 of 26\nGo Back\nFull Screen\nClose\nQuit\nIn measure theory, it has not been possible to date to construct a\nnonLebesgue measurable set without invoking the axiom of choice.\nIST does not allow figments to be picked up by the axiom of choice\nand for that reason, it would not be unreasonable to say that there are\nno nonLebesgue measurable sets in IST.\nIf we ignore figments, we can visualize the interval (0, 1) as a set\nwith virtual cardinality ℵ0. As a consequence, the Skolem paradox\ncannot be a serious problem in IST.\nMore than anything else, IST tells us to be realistic. It maintains\nthat there are points we cannot touch, and that there are spaces we\ncannot reach.\n· · · for a printable version of this paper · · ·\nclick here\nHome Page\nTitle Page\nContents\nJJ II\nJ I\nPage 26 of 26\nGo Back\nFull Screen\nClose\nQuit\n1.

This small study with 24 children aged 3 to 12 years found that \nthey can be highly involved. During interviews, the children and their \nparents talked about their everyday lives, their views on daily blood \ntests and insulin injections, food, doctors and nurses, the time when \ntheir diabetes was diagnosed, information and support, and how \nchildren ‘just want to get on with their lives’.  \n \nThe study found that: \n  \n Some young children understand a great deal about daily diabetes care, \nthe low-sugar diet, how to take and assess blood tests and inject insulin, \nand how to explain diabetes to other people. Some become very adept \nearly on, others prefer their mothers to manage most of the care.  From \nthe start, they need clear positive explanations about the daily routines, \nand why these are helpful; otherwise the diabetes care can seem cruel \nand pointless.  \n \n Besides having knowledge and skill, young children can be competent at \nmaking choices, managing difference, and being ‘normal’. Their main \ngoals tend to be ‘just to get on with life’ and to have fun with their friends. \nThey need routines that fit smoothly into their everyday life and goals. \n \n The 24 children and 29 parents we spoke with learn most about diabetes \nthrough personal experience, including children’s own bodily sensations, \nand the trial and error of finding out what works best. They tend to feel that \nthey have too much information at first, and too little information later on.  \n \n The small sample reported high levels of satisfaction with the care from \nthe specialist diabetes staff. Yet care from non-specialist practitioners \nposed very serious problems for most of the children, and school staff \nvaried in how helpful they were. \n \n Children and parents offer a wealth of information gained through their \npersonal experiences. These could help practitioners and policy makers \nto raise standards of diabetes health care, working as partners with \nchildren and parents.   \n \n \nSSRU – Social Science Research Unit, Institute of Education, University of London, \nwww.ioe.ac.uk/ssru/       April 2004 \nBackground\nThere is growing concern in Britain about \nthe rising rates of diabetes, the high \npersonal costs to the 1.3 million people \naffected, the great expense of treating \ndiabetes and its complications, and the \nshortage of specialist diabetes \npractitioners. Type II diabetes mainly \naffects adults. Type I diabetes starts in \nchildhood and can affect slim fit children \nwith a healthy life style. Unless new \ntreatments are found, they will need to \nhave daily insulin injections all their life. \nRates of type I diabetes are rising \namong young children. Yet very little \nresearch has been conducted with them \nabout their knowledge, views and \nexperiences – the topics of this research.  \n \nThe government aims to empower \npatients and promote partnership \nbetween patients and practitioners. We \nlooked at the ages when partnership can \nbegin.  \n  \nAims \n*  To find out about the views of children \naged 3 -12 years on living with diabetes, \nand sharing their health care in \npartnerships with adults. \n*  To explore how much they can share \nin managing their diabetes care.  \n*  To involve as highly varied a sample \nas possible, in terms of the ethnicity, \nsocio-economic background, age of the \nchildren, and their experience of \ndiabetes. \n*  To take account of extra difficulties \nchildren and parents may meet with at \nhome or school or in their community.  \n*  To provide reports on children’s views \nand experiences for children with \ndiabetes, their parents and carers, health \ncare professionals, policy makers and \nresearchers.  \n*  To learn from and help to promote \npositive ways of supporting and involving \nyounger children in their diabetes care.    \n \nMethods \n*  We met the children through three \nhospitals: two in London, one in the \nouter suburbs. With two groups we \nchose a purposive (deliberately wide-\nranging) sample, and sent them opt-in \nrequests, inviting them to join the project. \nFamilies that replied were mainly white \nand middle class and we met most of \nthem at their home. The third and more \ndiverse group was contacted and \ninterviewed in a diabetes clinic.  \n \n*  We piloted the interviews. These \nbegan by asking about the children’s \neveryday life, their friends, and things \nthey enjoy doing. We asked open \nquestions to encourage them to tell the \nstory of their life and about diabetes. \nSome children played a game and 11 did \na drawing. They all chose a research \nname. We also observed the three \nclinics and interviewed two doctors and \ntwo nurses. We transcribed the tapes, \nand analysed them for replies to our \nquestions and for themes raised by the \nchildren.  \n \nNew areas of research \nThis project is unusual in exploring four \nfairly new areas of research:  \n*  The views of children aged from 3 \nyears onwards;   \n*  Positive ways in which children can \nshare in managing their care; \n*  Social problems that arise in everyday \nlife, rather than personal problems within \nthe children themselves or their families; \n*  Methods of listening to children’s own \naccounts, rather than using tests, or \nquestionnaires, or solely adults’ replies.   \n  \nEarly competence \nDecisions \nEmma gave early examples of making \nsensible decisions. When aged 4 she \nknew she could have a little cake at \nparties, but the nursery staff often forgot. \nEmma would wait to ask her mother later \nto remind the staff for next time. Her \nfriend once found a box of chocolates \nand wanted Emma to share them. Emma \nrefused, as her blood test proved. When \nshe was 5, she arranged with her mother \nthat at parties she could do a blood test \nand then decide how many sweet things \nshe could eat. Perhaps more \ncomplicated than calculating what to eat, \nis the children’s competence in \nmanaging to be different from her friends \nbut still to be accepted fully by them.  \n  \nNeedles \n DJ was 6, and Nicola 4 when they did \ntheir own blood tests and injections, \nthough like other children Nicola \npreferred her mother to do injections \nsometimes.  \n  Children vary in what they feel able and \nwilling to do. Alex had needle phobia and \nat age 11 found injections very hard, as \ndid one of the mothers. When James \nwas diagnosed at age 7, he could do his \ninjections before his mother felt able to. \nWhen William was aged 7, he was \npleased that a young friend, who also \nhad diabetes, showed him how to start \ndoing injections.        \n \nFood and insulin \nFood and activity choices constantly \nrevolve around trying to balance blood \nsugar levels between too low and too \nhigh.  Jo aged 7 and her mother chose \nfood together for her packed lunch each \nday. Mr Football aged 9 was expert on \ncalories in types of foods. Children \nchecked calorie details on food or drink \npackets, and worked out their current \nblood sugar level against how much \nenergy they might need for the next few \nhours. Johnny managed an insulin pump \nand like Jimbo, also aged 11, adjusted \nhis insulin doses to fit his needs.  \n   \nUnderstanding \nIf they went to visit friends, some \nchildren did their routines and also \nexplained these. David aged 11 said \nsuccinctly: It’s an illness and an organ in \nyour body isn’t working, and it’s stopped \nproducing this liquid, and you need this \nliquid to turn sugar into energy, and this \nliquid is insulin, and so you have to have \ninjections of it. And you can’t have so \nmuch sugar in your food. \n \nMoral insight \nJessie aged 6 showed the children’s \nresponsible moral understanding when \nsaying ‘I’m sure’.   \nInterviewer:  This is my little girl. \nShe’s just got diabetes…Can you \ntell us what we need to do? \nJessie  … When she’s feeling low \nyou must always give her some \nsweets, and when she’s feeling \nhigh you must always, always not \ngive her sweets… \nInt:  And how would I know if she’s \nhigh or low? \nJessie:  She’ll tell you, I’m sure. \nInt:  Is there anything else I need to \ndo…? \nJessie:  Yes, you need to do your \nblood sugar [she explains how to \ndo so] and then you have to see \nhow high or low you are so you \ncan have some treats or not. So \nthat’s how you do it. \n \nOther findings \nThis short report is mainly about the \nchildren’s skill and understanding. Yet \nthey also described good care from \nspecialists and dangerously inadequate \ncare from non-specialist practitioners. \nThey talked about the first days when \nthey found they had diabetes and they \nraised questions about whether hospital \nor home was the best place for them to \nbe then, if they were well enough to go \nhome. Even it they played a very active \npart in their care, children did not \nnecessarily want to talk much in the \nclinics. They described how teachers \ncould be very helpful or very unhelpful.  \nMost of all, the children emphasised how \nthey wanted to be normal and to get on \nwith their lives. They needed devices \nand routines at home, nursery and \nschool, to help them to do so.  \nEarly conclusions \nWe aimed to find out if young children \ncan share in their diabetes care and talk \nto us about it. Their ability to take part in \nthe research demonstrates their ability to \nunderstand and take part in managing \ntheir diabetes care. They gave clear \nevidence of their competence, and some \nparents mentioned their surprise that \ntheir children were so able. \n \nYet although some children can be \nhighly responsible, this does not mean \nthey all either can be or want to be. Each \nchild may vary, sometimes wanting more \nhelp, sometimes less, without following a \nsingle pattern of growing independence. \nAnd they might, for example, be expert \nwith needles or about calories, but not \nwant to talk much with their doctor.  \n \nHaving found that it is very worthwhile \ntalking with younger children, we plan to \ndo a more thorough project with those \naged 3 – 8 years. We will allow more \ntime for participative research methods, \nsuch as asking them to take photos and \ndraw maps, or to use toys to explain \ntheir points as Jessie was doing when \nshe was quoted earlier.  \n \nWe also aim to allow time to explore \nchildren’s differing, sometimes \nambivalent views, and we will avoid \noffering hasty conclusions at this stage.  \n \nChildren and parents raised serious \nquestions for future research with larger \nsamples:  \n*  Are there better ways to inform them, \noffer them choices, support them after \ndiagnosis and over the following years?  \n*  How can GPs, A&E and general \nchildren’s ward staff improve their care?  \n*  How can school and nursery staff \nbecome more aware and respectful of \nthe children’s expertise? \n*  How can willing positive partnerships \nbetween younger children and adults be \nencouraged and problems be \nprevented? \n   \n \nChildren as partners in their diabetes \ncare: an exploratory research study  \nSeptember - December 2003 \n \nThank you to  \nAll the boys and girls and their parents \nwho kindly took part in interviews,  \nto Dr Charles Buchanan, Dr Abdus \nMallik and Dr Jeremy Allgrove, and the \ndiabetes nurses Patricia Gillard and  \nJulie Richardson, and to the 3 R+D and \n3 ethics committees for approving the \nproject.    \n \nResearchers   \nKaty Sutcliffe MSc Research Officer \nPriscilla Alderson PhD Professor \nSSRU - Social Science Research Unit \nInstitute of Education  \nUniversity of London \n18 Woburn Square  \nLondon WC1H ONR \nKatherine Curtis MSc Research Fellow \nChild Health Research and Policy Centre  \nInstitute of Health City University  \n \nFunding:  \nSSRU Childhood Research Fund \n \nReports   \nFor a free e-copy of the 90 page report \nemail  ssru@ioe.ac.uk \nFor printed copies send your order with \n£10 (free printed copies to interviewees). \nThere is also a 4 page report for \nchildren. \n \nSSRU \nFounded in 1990, SSRU conducts \nresearch on users’ views about health, \neducation and welfare services.  \nSSRU’s Childhood Research and Policy \nCentre runs an international information \nnetwork, courses and meetings, and an \nMA in understanding and working for \nchildren’s rights.    \n \n \n \n",

(REA) of research relevant to \ninterventions of interest to Targeted \nYouth Support.  It was commissioned by \nthe Department for Children, Schools and \nFamilies (DCSF) to inform the \ndevelopment of policy and practice in \nrelation to this initiative. \nThere are two components to the work \npresented in this document: 1) \nidentification and assessment of the risk \nfactors associated with the poor \noutcomes that TYS focuses on \n(“Component 1”); and 2) a rapid review \n(Rapid Evidence Assessment, or REA) of \nwhat services and interventions work to \nreduce the poor outcomes (“Component \n2”). The risk factors, identified in \nComponent 1, form the conceptual \nframework for the main part of the work: \nComponent 2, the REA. \n1.2 How to read this report \nThis report is divided into two parts: Part \nI focuses on the findings of the REA with \nonly very brief information given on the \nmethods; Part II describes the REA \nmethods in detail, as well as describing \nthe scope of research activity uncovered \nby our searches. \nIf you want to find out how this review \nwas undertaken you should read Part II of \nthe report. If you want to know the \nfindings of the review you should start \nwith read Part I. However, given the \nnature and range of topics covered in the \nreview, the reader may find it more \nuseful to focus on identifying the specific \nquestion that they are interested in and \nreading the findings in that part only \nrather than reading through all of the \nfindings.  The structure of the report \nfacilitates this.   \nPart 1 Section 7 contains the main results \nof the REA. It is based on a series of \nmatrices in which the risk factors \nidentified in Component 1 of this study \nare cross tabulated against the nine \noutcomes of interest (as defined in \nSection 5). This Section also contains a \ndescription of the nature of the \nrelationship between risk factor and \noutcome, and the findings from the \nsystematic reviews that address that \noutcome. \nSection 8 discusses multi-provider \ninterventions, as identified across the \noutcome areas, and attempts to draw \nsome conclusions about the nature of \nthese interventions and the topic areas \nwhich are targeted within them. Finally, \nSection 9 examines recurring or frequent \ntopics within the systematic reviews \nthematically, links between risk factors \nand outcome areas, and connections \nbetween these, to draw the findings of \nParts 1 and 2 together. \nA short summary of the REA is on the next \npage. \n6 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \n2 Summary \n \n2.1 Who wants to know and what \ndo they want to know? \nTargeted Youth Support (TYS) is an \ninitiative aimed at vulnerable young \npeople and involves ensuring that \nagencies work together to meet young \npeople‟s needs. The initiative‟s rationale \nis that a collaborative, „joined-up‟ \napproach is needed because young people \nmay have complex and multiple needs \nwhich cannot be met by mainstream or \nspecialist services in isolation. This report \nwas commissioned by the Department for \nChildren, Schools and Families (DCSF) to \nexplore what works for young people in \nrelation to the outcomes prioritised by \nthe TYS initiative. \n2.2 What did we do? \nWe were interested both in identifying \nwhich risks are associated with the \noutcomes targeted by TYS, and in \ninterventions which improve these \noutcomes, and so conducted this study in \ntwo parts: Component 1) identification \nand assessment of risk and protective \nfactors associated with TYS outcomes, \nand Component 2) a rapid review of \nsystematic reviews examining what \nservices and interventions work to reduce \nthe poor outcomes. \n2.3 What did we find? \nWe identified 29 risk and protective \nfactors. The risk factors fell into five \nmain areas: family, school, community, \nindividuals and peers. We found 57 \nsystematic reviews about what works and \nrelated these to the risk and protective \nfactors.  \nWe found that rarely, if ever, were all \nknown risk factors addressed by the \nincluded reviews; for example, one out of \nfour known individual risk factors for \nmental health was addressed by the \ninterventions we identified. Protective \nfactors, where known, were all addressed \nin the reviews. The risk factors relating to \ndrug and alcohol misuse, NEET, and low \nattainment were rarely addressed in the \nreviews. \nMore risk factors at the individual and \nfamily levels were identified (and more \naddressed) than at the school and \ncommunity levels. This either suggests \nthat individual and family levels are more \nimportant in determining behaviour or is \nsimply a reflection of an emphasis in \nresearch and policy on personal \nresponsibility and behaviour change. \nMany studies were not always clear that \nthey were targeting a specific risk-factor \nat all; they were aiming to improve a \nparticular outcome.  \nWe found a reasonable quantity of \nevidence on multi-component \ninterventions, which are particularly \nrelevant to TYS, but less detail on the \nspecific sub-groups that might be \naffected by them. This information \n(where available) is included in detail in \nthe report.  \n \n \n \n \n \n7 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPart I: Background and results of the rapid evidence assessment \n \n3    Background \n8 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \n3 Background \n \nIn 2003, the Government published its \nGreen Paper entitled Every Child \nMatters. This paper contained five \noutcomes the Government wanted to see \nall young people achieving: being \nhealthy, staying safe, enjoying and \nachieving, making a positive contribution, \nand economic well-being (p.14). \nThis was followed by the Green Paper, \nYouth Matters in July 2005 which \nincluded a consultation which was \ncompleted the following November. The \nconsultation included more than 19,000 \nresponses from young people, and the \nGovernment‟s response, Youth Matters: \nNext Steps was published in March 2006 \nwith the sub-heading “Something to do, \nsomewhere to go, someone to talk to”. \nOne of the findings of the consultation \nwas that “62% of young people would like \none professional person to go to for \nadvice and information” and that “70% of \nadults/organisations supported bringing \ntogether within children‟s trusts \nresponsibility for commissioning different \nservices which provide support to young \npeople with additional needs” (Summary, \np.9). At the time, targeted youth support \npathfinders were being tested in 14 local \nauthorities. The learning from these \nprojects was summarised in Targeted \nyouth support: a guide in 2007 (DfES \n2007). \nTargeted Youth Support (TYS) is aimed at \nvulnerable young people and involves \nensuring that agencies work together to \nmeet their needs. Its rationale is that, \nsince they may have complex and \nmultiple needs which cannot be met by \nmainstream or specialist services in \nisolation, a collaborative, „joined-up‟ \napproach is needed. TYS is made up of \nseven elements:  \n Strengthening the influence of \nvulnerable young people, and \ntheir families and communities, \nand their ability to bring about \npositive change \n Identifying vulnerable young \npeople early, in the context of \ntheir everyday lives \n Building a clear picture of \nindividual needs, shared by young \npeople and the agencies working \nwith them, using the common \nassessment framework (CAF) \n Enabling vulnerable young people \nto receive early support in \nuniversal settings. Helping all \nagencies to draw in extra help on \nbehalf of young people, through \nbetter links with other agencies \nand organisations \n Ensuring vulnerable young people \nreceive a personalised package of \nsupport, information, advice and \nguidance, and learning and \ndevelopment opportunities, with \nsupport for their parents or carers \nas appropriate… \n Providing support for vulnerable \nyoung people across transitions, \nfor example moving on from \nschool or from the support of one \nservice to another as needs \nchange \n Making services more accessible, \nattractive and relevant for \nvulnerable young people (DfES \n2007: 4) \n \n \n3    Background \n9 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \n \nTargeted youth support is delivered \ncollaboratively through a range of \nservices, including: education welfare, \nbehaviour support, Connexions, youth \nservices, social services, drugs and \nalcohol, sexual health, mental health, \nhousing support, school nurses, youth \noffending services; and through Positive \nActivities for Young People, the Young \nPeople's Development Programme, \nPositive Futures, youth inclusion \nprogrammes, and the Teenage Pregnancy \nStrategy.1 \n3.1 The need for the Rapid \nEvidence Assessment \nThere have been two reviews of TYS \ncarried out by the Prime Minister‟s \nDelivery Unit (PMDU). These reviews have \nidentified a lack of evidence-based \npractice at local delivery levels and state \nthat this is a barrier to effective \nimplementation of the TYS initiative. The \nfirst PMDU review, in 2006, proposed \nseven work streams, one of which was to: \n\"Develop an evidence-based best practice \nin interventions and system designs – To \nensure better understanding of and \nevidence for what types of interventions \nwith young people at risk work, and in \nwhat circumstances; and ensure better \ngovernment facilitation of sharing \nlearning between areas.\" This need was \nconfirmed by the second review, in 2007. \nMoreover, since an „accelerated delivery \nplan‟ for TYS has been agreed recently (6 \nAugust, 2007), the need for evidence to \nsupport this became urgent at the time \nthis work was commissioned. \nThere was thus a policy need for evidence \nto support the delivery of TYS, and also a \nneed for the evidence to be produced  \n                                                          \n1\n \nhttp://www.everychildmatters.gov.uk/deliveri\nngservices/targetedyouthsupport/whatis/ \n \nquickly, necessitating the rapidity of this \nwork and the methods it used. \n \n4    Aims and objectives \n10 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \n4 Aims and objectives \n \nThis project aimed to support the \ndelivery of TYS by collating the available \nevidence of “what works?” to reduce poor \noutcomes among young people. Different \nyoung people are at risk of different \noutcomes so, when they first come into \ncontact with TYS, it may not be clear \nwhich outcomes any one young person is \nat risk of and, hence, what support might \nbe most appropriate. This project \ntherefore also aimed to identify the \nspecific risk factors that are associated \nwith given poor outcomes and the \ninterventions that target them. \nIn order to achieve these aims, the \nobjectives of this project were to: \n1. identify the risk factors that are \nassociated with the poor \noutcomes TYS aims to reduce; \nand \n2. identify interventions that are \neffective at reducing the poor \noutcomes. \n \n5    Definitions of key terms in this work \n11 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \n5 Definitions of key terms in this work \n \nRisk and protective factors \nRisk factors are taken to mean those \ncharacteristics or variables associated \nwith future potential harm, whilst \nprotective factors are those \ncharacteristics or variables which \nameliorate or neutralise the effects of \nrisk factors. In this definition, a \nprotective factor is more than simply a \nreduction in level of risk, as an individual \nmay have high levels of both risk and \nprotective factors. \nPoor outcomes: These are taken from the \nTargeted Youth Support Guide, page 6 \nand describe the outcomes that TYS aims \nto reduce. These outcomes are referred \nto as the TYS Outcomes throughout this \nreport. They are: \n- Youth offending / anti-social \nbehaviour \n- Drug or alcohol misuse \n- Under-18 conceptions and poor \nsexual health \n- Poor outcomes for teenage \nparents and their children \n- 16-18 year-olds not in education, \nemployment and training (NEET) \n- Low attainment  \n- Running away and youth \nhomelessness \n- Poor mental health \nPlease note that an additional outcome, \n„Entry into care‟, is also listed in the TYS \nguide, but after discussion with the \nDepartment was not included in the scope \nof this REA. Three potentially relevant \nreviews were identified, they did not \nmeet our final criteria for inclusion and \nwould not have made it through into the \nresults of this review.  \nYoung people are people aged 13-19 \nyears. \n6    Methods \n12 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \n6 Methods \n \nThere are two components to the work \npresented in this document: 1) \nidentification and assessment of the risk \nfactors associated with the poor \noutcomes that TYS focuses on \n(“Component 1”); and 2) a rapid review \n(Rapid Evidence Assessment, or REA) of \nwhat services and interventions work to \nreduce the poor outcomes (“Component \n2”). The risk factors, identified in \nComponent 1, form the conceptual \nframework for the main part of the work: \nComponent 2, the REA. \nThis Part contains a brief outline of the \nmethods used in this project. Part II of \nthis report describes the methods in much \ngreater depth. \nOne aspect of the project was concerned \nwith eliciting the views of experts in the \nfield through an expert panel. \nMembership of the panel was decided in \nconsultation with the DCSF, and included \nleading policy, practice and research \npersonnel.  \nWhile the use of „experts‟ is sometimes \ncontested by those advocating a pure and \nunbiased „evidence-based‟ approach, it is \nimportant to take account of people‟s \nexperiential knowledge. This project \ntherefore used a panel of experts \nthroughout the work to help to identify \nrelevant research and particularly at the \ncompletion of the research – in order to \nhelp to interpret its findings and assess \nits implications for the delivery of \nservices.  \nSince organising meetings of busy people \nin a fairly short time period can prove \nproblematic, we circulated the protocol \n(to this group) by email for feedback and \nto request relevant research, and then \nthe group met face-to-face on 3 April \n2008 to discuss the findings of the draft \nreport. \n6.1 Component 1: risk factors \nThe timescale for this work was short and \nconducting a full review of research in \nthis area would necessarily have been \ntime-consuming. Therefore, a non-\nsystematic scoping exercise was \nundertaken to find longitudinal or cohort \nstudies able to identify risk factors that \nare associated with the TYS outcomes \nlisted in Section 5.  \nRisk factors do not, of course, always \noperate in isolation. There are varying \ndegrees of risk, and some risk factors \noperate in combination with one another \n– and, of course, some of the TYS \noutcomes, could themselves be \nconsidered to be risk factors (and vice \nversa). Thus, as well as listing potential \nrisk factors, any models of association \nthat we found in the literature were also \nidentified. \nIn addition to risk factors, there is the \nquestion of resilience. While some young \npeople have particular risk factors and go \non to suffer one or more of the poor \noutcomes listed, many with the same risk \nfactors do not. An additional question \ntherefore, is what factors appear to \nprotect against poor outcomes, in young \npeople with similar risk factors? \nThe research questions for this \ncomponent were: \n1. What factors are associated with \nthe TYS outcomes? \n2. Which factors have the largest \nassociation with these outcomes? \n \n6    Methods \n13 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \n \n3. Which combinations of factors are \nassociated with one or more of \nthe above outcomes? \n4. What other (protective) factors \nare associated with the absence \nof poor outcomes among young \npeople with similar risk factors? \nThe outcome of this work is a matrix \nwhich associates risk factors with TYS \noutcomes. Each cell contains a narrative \n(where available from the text) of the \nprimary research that supports the \nassociation (thus, some cells will be \nempty). This matrix also forms the \nconceptual framework for Component 2: \nthe REA.   \nThe purpose developing the risk and \nprotective factor matrices was to identify \nrecurrent patterns that were found in the \nlongitudinal studies.  We decided to \norganise the risk factors into families of \nassociated risk domains: individual, \nfamily, school and community. \n6.2 Component 2, the REA: what \nservices and interventions \nwork to reduce the TYS \noutcomes? \nSince this work crosses many different \nsectors and topics, it was not feasible to \nconduct a systematic review of all \npotentially relevant primary research. \nTherefore, the method for this \nComponent was a rapid systematic review \nof systematic reviews. Systematic reviews \ncan be considered a short-cut to the \nresearch evidence because they aim to \navoid drawing wrong or misleading \nconclusions that arise either from biases \nwithin the research studies they contain, \nor from the way the reviews themselves \nwere conducted. Characteristics of \nsystematic reviews are that they specify \nhow studies were located; how they were \nincluded; how they were quality \nappraised; and how they were  \n \nsynthesised (EPPI-Centre 2007). We \nchecked that the systematic reviews we \nincluded did indeed have these \ncharacteristics and brought their findings \ntogether into common threads of \neffectiveness across sectors. \nThe research questions for this \ncomponent are: \n What services and interventions \nare effective in reducing the TYS \noutcomes among young people? \n Which risk factors, identified in \nComponent 1, do they target? \n Where available, what evidence is \nthere on the cost effectiveness of \nthese interventions? \nIn order to answer these questions, we \nsought systematic reviews in the TYS \noutcome areas defined in Section 5. We \ndeveloped a Boolean search strategy and \nsearched 16 online databases, key \nacademic and other websites, Google \nScholar and, in addition to these \nelectronic searches, the reference lists of \nincluded reviews were scanned to locate \nother, potentially relevant, reviews. \nOver 7,900 potentially relevant \nreferences were identified, of which just \nover 2000 were duplicates. After \nscreening these references for inclusion, \n162 were found to meet our inclusion \ncriteria (see Part II of this report for \ncomplete details). These were given \nkeywords and formed the focus of a \ndiscussion with the DCSF to inform the in-\ndepth phase of the review. \nAfter a further screening for quality and \nrelevance, the results of this REA are \nbased on a set of 57 systematic reviews.   \nIt is clear, therefore, that although quite \na large number of research papers \ninitially met our inclusion criteria, only \none-third of these subsequently proved to  \n6    Methods \n14 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \n \nbe of sufficient quality and relevance to \ninclude in our report. This highlights the \nneed for caution when reading and \ninterpreting research evidence, \nparticularly when using it as a basis from \nwhich to develop policy. \n6.3 Structure and framework of \nthe results in this report \nThe remainder of Part I of the report \ncontains the results of the REA. \nSection 7 contains the main results of the \nREA: a description of the nature of the \nrelationship between risk factor and \noutcome, and the findings from the \nsystematic reviews that address that \noutcome. \nSince Targeted Youth Support aims \nexplicitly to link relevant services \ntogether in a tailored way for young \npeople, the review also identified \nevidence on multi-component (or multi-\nprovider) interventions. The results of \nthis part of the analysis can be found in \nSection 8. \nFinally, a thematic overview of cross-\ncutting issues is presented in Section 9. \nFirst, topics or sub-groups of young \npeople which recurred frequently across \nthe five main areas of risk factors were \ncollated and discussed to identify trends \nand subsequent gaps in the research. \nSecondly, the number of associations \nbetween risk factors and outcomes at \neach level (individual/peer, family, \nschool, and community) was identified. \nThis association matrix was used to \ndisplay patterns and trends in research. \nThe findings from these stages are \ndiscussed in conjunction with the rest of \nthe report to draw overarching themes. \n \n7    Results: risk and protective factors, associated outcomes and systematic reviews of effectiveness \n15 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \n7 Results: risk and protective factors, associated outcomes and \nsystematic reviews of effectiveness \n \nThis chapter describes the evidence \nabout the effectiveness of youth \ninterventions and associated risk factors \naccording to the TYS outcomes. The \ninterventions described below were \ncharacterised by target population, \ntarget outcomes, setting, and type of \nintervention. Within each section, \nsyntheses of findings have been \nconducted, using varying characteristics \nas the ordering principle as appropriate. \nSome reviews are therefore described \nmore than once, and there is overlap \nbetween the subsections under each \noutcome heading. \n7.1 Cautionary notes in \ninterpreting the findings of \nthis review \nThis section discusses two important \nconsiderations to be borne in mind when \ninterpreting the findings of this review:  \nfirstly, the distinction between \ncorrelation and causation and secondly, \nthe possible role of moderating factors on \nthe effects of interventions. \nThis REA makes extensive use of \ncorrelational studies in order to \nunderstand more about the relationships \nbetween risk factors and poor outcomes. \nHowever, the results of these studies \nneed to be interpreted carefully since \nthey usually do not usually justify the \ninference of a causal link between a given \nrisk factor and an outcome, particularly \nwhen there is no other evidence to \nsupport a link. \nFor example, the fact that poor housing is \na risk factor that is statistically \nassociated with teenage pregnancy / poor \nsexual health does not mean that that \npoor housing causes teenage pregnancy. \nIt is very difficult to determine in any \nindividual case, whether a risk factor \ncaused a particular outcome, or even that \nit was a contributory factor. \nNevertheless, in a detailed report \naddressing the environmental causes of \ndisease, Rutter et al (2007) emphasize \nthat non-experimental methods of \nresearch do have a valuable role to play \nin enabling us to make causal inferences, \nproviding certain stringent conditions are \nmet. The example of smoking and lung \ncancer is quoted as the most successful \nexample of research of this kind, where \nthe probable causal relationship was \nobserved long before compelling evidence \nemerged. (p.19; p.75) \nThe same is true of social research; \nwhere randomised controlled trials are \nnot appropriate, close, systematic \nobservation of relationships between risk \nfactors and outcomes may, as part of an \noverall body of evidence from various \nsources, help us to identify the most \nimportant influences on young people‟s \nhealth and behaviour. However, as Rutter \net al (2007) point out, we need to assess \nthe strength and reliability of any \nevidence carefully before using it to \nformulate public policy. Pilot studies and \nrigorous evaluation should also form an \nintegral part of any new policy \nimplementation (ibid, p.90).  \nWhen assessing the potential impact of \nany intervention, it is vital to be aware of \nthe extensive body of evidence on the \nrole of moderating factors, on \noutcomes.   Put simply, this means that \nan intervention which works for one \ngroup of young people may have no \ncomparable effect on another.  There is a \ngrowing scientific literature on gene-\nenvironment interactions, highlighting the \npossible importance of genetic \n7    Results: risk and protective factors, associated outcomes and systematic reviews of effectiveness \n16 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \nmoderation of environmental risk effects. \n(Rutter et al 2007, p. 25). For example, \nstudies have shown that “maltreatment‟ \nin childhood is associated with an \nincreased risk of both antisocial \nbehaviour and depressive disorders in \nadolescence/early adult life, but the risk \neffect is largely confined to those with \nparticular genetic variants” (Caspi et al \n2002, 2003; quoted in Rutter et al  2007, \np. 36).   \nSimilarly, social context may be a \nmoderating factor. For example, Jaffee \net al (2002) found that close involvement \nby fathers in their children‟s upbringing \nwas “psychologically protective”, but \nconversely, their involvement led to \nincreased risk if the fathers were \n“seriously antisocial” (in Rutter et al \n2007, p. 36). \nIn summary, we need to acknowledge \nthat the causes of any behavioural \noutcome in a young person will be \ncomplex, and that this will be reflected \nin their need for targeted support.  \nAlthough we have identified recurrent \nassociations between risk factors and \nbehavioural outcomes, caution is needed \nwhen applying this knowledge to any \ngiven individuals. The evidence, as yet, is \nnot strong enough to enable us to make \nconfident predictive statements. \nHowever, the patterns can help us to \nunderstand the pathways which may lead \nto individuals‟ situations; we can identify \ncommon pathways from certain \ncombinations of risk factors, but when \ndelivering services, a flexible and \nindividualised approach must be taken to \nreflect the complexity of human \nbehaviour.  \nAs Rutter et al (2007) point out: “Not \nonly is there not just one cause, but none \nis the basic cause. What is most \nimportant will depend on which elements \nin the causal pathway can be manipulated \nmost successfully.” (2007; p.23).  \n7.2 Youth offending/anti-social \nbehaviour \n7.2.1 Risk factors \nAll the risk factors we identified are \nassociated with Youth offending/anti-\nsocial behaviour. \nThe family risk factors are: \n- Poor parental supervision and \ndiscipline \n- Family conflict (including physical \nand sexual abuse) \n- Family history of problem \nbehaviour (including poor mental \nhealth) \n- Parental involvement/ attitudes \ncondoning problem behaviour \n- Low income and poor housing \n(including family structure and \nsize) \n- Experience of authority care \nSeveral Home Office research studies \ndrawing upon data from the Youth \nLifestyles Survey of 1998/9 found that the \nlikelihood of offending is substantially \nincreased if the parent has themselves \noffended (Richardson and Budd (2000), \nHome Office Research Study 263; Flood-\nPage et al (2001)). The degree to which \nteenagers are supervised by their parents \nis directly related to the number of \nevenings that they go out: generally, \nyoung teens who went out several \nevenings during the week or who went to \npubs, night-clubs or parties were more \nlikely to be offenders. Moreover, hostile, \nantisocial behaviour can elicit a negative \nresponse from parents and so lock those \ninvolved into a cycle of relationship \ndeterioration (Youth Lifestyles Survey \np.33, in Flood-Page et al, 2001). Family \nbreakdown was found to be a risk factor \nfor youth offending in a review of nine \nstudies evaluating the Targeted Youth \n7    Results: risk and protective factors, associated outcomes and systematic reviews of effectiveness \n17 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \nSupport Pathfinders by Rodger et al \n(2007). \nThe Youth Justice Board (YJB) report by \nAnderson (2001) on the risk and \nprotective factors associated with youth \ncrime found that each of the family risk \nfactors, but particularly having a family \nhistory of problem behaviour, \nsignificantly increased the likelihood of a \nyoung person reporting having ever been \narrested or having ever stolen something. \nA family history of problem behaviour \nequalled a 62 percent increase in the \nodds of having been arrested or having \nstolen something. While low income was \nnot measured directly, some demographic \ninformation about participants could be \nused as proxy measures for household \nincome. Those young people who \nreported not having a car were 93 \npercent more likely to report having been \narrested; on the other hand, the odds \ndecreased by 8 percent for each \nadditional room in the house. \nExperience of being in authority care was \nidentified as a risk factor in both the YJB \nreport Anderson (2001) and the Rodger et \nal (2007) report. \nThe school risk factors are: \n- Low achievement beginning in \nprimary school \n- Aggressive behaviour, including \nbullying \n- Lack of commitment, including \ntruancy \n- School exclusions \n- School disorganisation \nTwo studies have found that low levels of \neducational attainment and disliking \nschool are predictive of later offending \n(Rodger et al 2007; Flood-Page et al \n2000) and being a bully in school is \nassociated with offending – both while at \nschool, and after leaving. Young people \nwho were both victims and perpetrators \nof bullying were also more likely to \noffend. School exclusions and suspensions \nare linked with increased rates of \noffending and, in the case of exclusions, \nwith violent crime. \nUnauthorised absences and truancy, \nparticularly chronic or repeated truancy, \nwas strongly linked to offending \nbehaviour. Truancy was also a predictor \nof offending in later life among those \naged 17 and over: those who were \npersistent truants when they were at \nschool were more likely to be offenders \nlater on (The Audit Commission, 1996). \nIn the Youth Lifestyles Survey of 1998/9, \nauthors found that among the 12-16 year \nolds who were persistent truants, almost \nhalf of the boys and a third of the girls \nwere offenders, compared to only 10 \npercent of those who had not or had \nrarely truanted (Flood-Page et al 2000).  \nThe YJB report (Anderson 2001) predicted \na 25 percent increase in self-reported \narrests with the risk factor: lack of \ncommitment to school, but by far the \nhighest increase in odds of offending in \nthis study was for low achievement in \nschool, with a 90 percent increase in the \nodds of self-reported arrests (the highest \npercentage change in odds of the risk \nfactors). In addition, young people who \nreported low achievement in school were \n52 percent more likely to report that they \nhad ever having stolen something (the \nsecond highest percentage difference \napart from „having a family history of \nproblem behaviour‟). Two other studies \nalso found low achievement at school to \nbe a risk factor for offending and \nantisocial behaviour. \nThe community risk factors are: \n- Community disorganisation and \nneglect (including lack of suitable \nleisure facilities) \n- Availability of drugs \n7    Results: risk and protective factors, associated outcomes and systematic reviews of effectiveness \n18 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \n- High turnover and lack of \nneighbourhood attachment \nBoys who „hung around‟ public places \nwere found to have four times the \noffending rates compared with those who \ndid not (Youth Lifestyles Survey, p.60, in: \nFlood-Page et al 2000). High turnover and \nlack of neighbourhood attachment \n(measured by how many times a young \nperson said they had moved house) \nincreased the odds of self-reported \narrests by 25 percent, but by only 10 \npercent for self-reported theft. A lack of \nsupport services was a risk factor \nidentified by Rodger et al (2007). \nThe individual and peer risk factors are: \n- Alienation and lack of social \ncommitment \n- Personal attitudes that condone \nproblem behaviour \n- Early involvement in problem \nbehaviour \n- Friends involved in problem \nbehaviour \n- Cognitive function and mental \nhealth \n- Gender \n- Age \n- Ethnic background \nPersonal attitudes appear to be \nassociated with offending, since those \nwho had been caught for an offence in \nthe previous twelve months were \nsignificantly less likely to recognise a \n“wrongful act” compared with those who \nhad not (Mori 2002, p.29). The YJB report \n(Anderson, 2001) also found that young \npeople with attitudes that condoned \nproblem behaviour – such as stealing or \ntaking drugs – increased their odds of \nself-reported arrest by 11 percent and 14 \npercent for self-reported stealing. As well \nas family members (see above), Graham \nand Bowling (1995) found that those with \nneighbours and friends who had been in \ntrouble with the police were more likely \nto be in trouble themselves. Moreover, \nanother survey (Mori 2002) found that \ntwo thirds of offenders usually offended \nwith someone else (e.g. a friend).  \nRodger et al (2007)also found that a \ndeviant peer group was identified as a \nrisk factor across nine studies reviewed \nrelating to youth offending, and having \nfriends involved in problem behaviour was \nassociated with large and significant \nincreases in the odds of being arrested \n(50 percent) and stealing (44 percent) \nidentified in the YJB report (Anderson, \n2001). These were the largest percentage \nincreases in this set of risk factors. \nDemographic characteristics such as age, \ngender and ethnicity were also associated \nwith levels of risk. Being male increased \nthe odds of being arrested by 146 \npercent, the single largest increase in \nodds of being arrested for any of the \ndemographic or risk and protective \nfactors identified by the YJB report \n(Anderson 2001). By contrast, the \npercentage increase in odds for stealing \nwas only 21 percent, suggesting that \neither low level offending was less \nassociated with gender than more serious \noffences and/or anti-social behaviour, or \nthat males were more likely to be \narrested than females, whatever the \noffence.  \nBeing from a black or mixed minority \nbackground was linked to experiences of \nrisk factors associated with youth \noffending.  (Rodger et al 2007). Age was \nassociated with offending in both younger \nand older groups. Early onset of problem \nbehaviour was associated with more \nserious and persistent offending in later \nyears, whilst older year groups were more \nlikely to be currently involved in \noffending and/or antisocial behaviour, an \nincrease of 16 percent with each school \nyear according to the YJB report \n(Anderson, 2001) – though this behaviour \n7    Results: risk and protective factors, associated outcomes and systematic reviews of effectiveness \n19 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \ndoes not necessarily continue into \nadulthood. \nThe protective factors are: \n- Strong bonds with family, friends \nand teachers \n- Healthy standards set by parent, \nteachers and community leaders \n- Opportunities for involvement in \nfamilies, school and community \n- Social and learning skills to \nenable participation \n- Recognition and praise for \npositive behaviour \nOverall, those who had a weak family \nattachment were more likely to currently \nbe a serious or persistent offender (12 \npercent compared to 8 percent of those \nwith a strong bond). The relationship was \nstronger for women than for men. \nSimilarly, those who spent a lot of time \nwith their parents were less likely to \noffend than those who lived with their \nparents but spent little time with them \n(Youth Lifestyles Survey p.33, in: Flood-\nPage et al 2000). In the YJB report \n(Anderson 2001), strong family \nattachment was associated with a \ndecrease in odds of arrest and for stealing \nby 7 percent each; experiencing positive \naspects of school life was associated with \na decrease in odds of arrests by 15 \npercent and for stealing by 12 percent. \nRecognition from teachers brought about \na 15 percent decrease in the odds of \nbeing arrested and a 12 percent decrease \nin odds for stealing. The percentage \ndecreases for protective factors were not \nas great as for the percentage increases \nassociated with some risk factors, \nsuggesting that effective interventions \nwould likely strengthen protective factors \nas well as reducing levels of risk. In this \nreport a good relationship with one‟s \nparents was a weaker protective factor \ncompared to recognition from teachers \nand positive experiences of school life. \n7.2.2  Systematic reviews \nParenting and family therapy-based \nInterventions \nInterventions in this group all comprise of \nan activity that involves the family of the \nyoung person at risk. The interventions \nvary in the degree to which the focus is \non improving the skills of the parent \nand/or relationships within the family. \nThe evidence of effectiveness of this type \nof intervention provided by the reviews is \ncontradictory. \nIn a US-based meta-analysis, Anderson \n(1996) evaluated the effectiveness of \nparent management training and found \nthat the average effect was positive. A \nUK-based review of 21 studies evaluated \nthe cost–effectiveness of health therapies \nfor prevention and treatment of \npsychiatric problems in children and \nyoung people (Romeo et al 2005). They \nfound that parent and child training \nprogrammes led to child behavioural \ngains and parent satisfaction from parent \nand child training programmes. They \nreport that there was little good evidence \nabout the issue of cost-effectiveness in \nthe field. \nIn a UK-based systematic review, \nWoolfenden et al (2001) evaluated family \nand parenting programmes to improve the \nbehaviour of juveniles with conduct \ndisorder or delinquency. They found that \nfamily and parenting interventions \nsignificantly reduced time spent by \njuveniles in institutions, although not \nincarceration rates. There was a further \nreduction in the risk of a juvenile being \nrearrested and in the rates of subsequent \narrests, but the authors note that all \nthese results should be interpreted with \ncaution due to their heterogeneity. \nWoolfenden et al (2001) found no \nsignificant difference for psychosocial \noutcomes such as family functioning, and \nchild/adolescent behaviour. \nSimilarly, in a US-based meta-analysis of \n8 studies, Littell et al (2005) evaluated \n7    Results: risk and protective factors, associated outcomes and systematic reviews of effectiveness \n20 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \nthe impact of Multisystemic Therapy (MST \nis a family behavioural therapy) on \nreducing out-of-home living \narrangements, crime and delinquency and \nother behavioural and psychosocial \noutcomes. They found that results were \ninconclusive as to whether MST was more \neffective than other usual services in \nrestricting out-of-home living \narrangements or arrests, but also no \nevidence that MST has harmful effects. \nSchool-based violence reduction \nprogrammes  \nThese interventions are based in schools \nand set out specifically to reduce violent \nand disruptive behaviour by teaching \nsocial or personal skills, strategies for \ndealing with confrontation and conflict, \nteam work, or behavioural (e.g. reduction \nof aggression) change. The young people \ntargeted varied between reviews as did \nthe exact nature of the intervention. The \nreviews were consistent in finding \npositive effects for this type of \nintervention.  \nIn a US -based meta-analysis of 36 \nstudies, Garrard & Lipsey (2007) \nevaluated the effectiveness of Conflict \nResolution Education (CRE) programmes \nin US schools in reducing antisocial \nbehaviour. They found CRE to be \neffective in reducing antisocial behaviour \nparticularly in mid- and early \nadolescence. In a US-based systematic \nreview of 53 studies, Hahn et al (2007) \nevaluated the effectiveness of universal \nschool–based programmes in reducing or \npreventing violent or aggressive \nbehaviour in children and adolescents. \nThey found that results consistently \nindicated that universal school-based \nprogrammes in low SES communities or \nthose characterised by high crime rates, \nwere effective in reducing violence in \nyoung people. \nIn a UK review and meta-analysis of 44 US \n& UK randomised controlled trials (RCTs), \nMytton et al (2002) evaluated school -\nbased interventions designed to reduce \naggression, violence, bullying, conflict or \nanger amongst children in mandatory \neducation at risk of violence and \naggression, and found an overall \nreduction in aggression. They stated that \ntheir results suggested that interventions \nmay be more effective in older groups \nand when administered to mixed sex \ngroups rather than boys alone. An update \nof this review by the same authors in \n2007 (Mytton et al 2007) found an overall \nreduction in aggression both in primary \nand secondary school immediately after \nthe intervention. The authors state that \nlonger term follow-up results did not \nshow a benefit in the primary school \ngroup but did in the secondary school age \ngroup. Further, they state that subgroup \nanalyses suggested that interventions \ndesigned to improve relationship or social \nskills may be more effective than \ninterventions designed to teach skills of \nnon-response to provocative situations, \nbut that benefits were similar when \ndelivered to children in primary versus \nsecondary school, and to groups of mixed \nsex versus boys alone. This contrasts with \nthe findings by the same researchers in \n2002. \nIn a large meta-analysis of 219 studies, \nWilson & Lipsey (2005) evaluated the \neffectiveness of school-based \nprogrammes for preventing or reducing \naggressive and disruptive behaviour. They \ndivided these programmes into groups \nrepresenting distinct programme formats. \nThey found that “universal”, \n“selected/indicated” and \n“comprehensive” programmes were all \ngenerally effective at reducing the more \ncommon types of aggressive behaviour \nseen in schools, such as fighting, name \ncalling, intimidation and other negative \ninterpersonal behaviours.  Approaches \ninvolving social skills, behavioural or \ncognitive programmes or counselling were \nall equally effective in reducing \naggressive behaviour. The effects were \nespecially noticeable among the higher-\n7    Results: risk and protective factors, associated outcomes and systematic reviews of effectiveness \n21 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \nrisk students and those already exhibiting \npotentially problematic behaviour.    \nCommunity-based residential \nplacement/ foster care   \nIn this type of intervention, young people \nat risk of anti-social behaviour or \noffending are given a residential \nplacement usually as part of a sentence. \nSuch placements are non-secure but vary \nin intensity from placements with a \n„foster family‟ to placement in a small \ngroup home.   \nIn a US-based systematic review of 5 \nstudies, Hahn et al (2005) assessed two \nsimilar interventions. Therapeutic foster \ncare for reduction of violence by children \nwith severe emotional disturbance \n(termed “cluster therapeutic foster \ncare”) involved programmes lasting on \naverage 18 months, in which clusters of \nfoster-parent families cooperated in the \ncare of children (aged 5-13 years) with \nsevere emotional disturbance. The review \nwas unable to determine the \neffectiveness of this intervention in \npreventing violence, as there were too \nfew studies upon which to base a \nconclusion. Therapeutic foster care \naimed at reducing violence by chronically \ndelinquent adolescents (termed \n“programme-intensive therapeutic foster \ncare”) involved short-term programmes, \nlasting on average 6-7 months, in which \nprogramme personnel collaborated \nclosely and daily with foster families \ncaring for adolescents (aged 12-18 years) \nwith a history of chronic delinquency.   \nThe review found evidence that this \nintervention brought about a significant \ndecrease in violence, aggressive \nbehaviour and self-reported felonies.  It \nwas also cost effective compared to \nstandard treatments. However, certain \nstudies reviewed indicated a potentially \nnegative effect of therapeutic foster care \namong females. \nIn a UK -based review and meta-analysis, \nNewman et al (2007) found that \ncommunity-based family residential \nplacement was more effective than \n“standard” residential placement for \nfemale juvenile offenders. However they \nfound promising but insufficient evidence \nthat community-based family residential \nplacement was more effective than \n„standard‟ residential placement for male \njuvenile offenders. The authors suggest \nthat the finding may indicate that the \nnature of the placement (i.e. 1 to 1 or \nsmall group family home) may be more \nimportant for boys than girls. \nMacDonald and Turner (2008) conducted a \nreview that aimed to assess the impact of \nTreatment Foster Care (TFC) on \npsychosocial and behavioural outcomes, \ndelinquency, placement stability and \ndischarge status for children and \nadolescents requiring out-of-home \nplacement.  They describe TFC as “a \nfoster family-based intervention that \naims to provide young people with a \ntailored programme designed to effect \npositive changes in their lives”. The \nauthors analysed 5 studies, four of which \nfocused on young offenders or children \nwith behavioural problems, whilst the \nfifth included young people in a state \nmental hospital. The findings suggest that \nTFC may be a useful intervention for \nchildren and young people with complex \nemotional, psychological and behavioural \nneeds, who are at risk of placement in \nnon-family settings such as hospital, \nsecure residential or youth justice \nsettings.   \nSocial and cognitive skills interventions \nThis group of interventions can be broadly \nviewed as education and training \ninterventions that aim to provide the \nyoung person with the social skills \nnecessary to manage relationships and/or \nthe knowledge and skills necessary to \ncomplete their education, live \nindependently and gain employment. The \nreviews of these types of interventions \nwere consistent in finding a positive \neffect. \n7    Results: risk and protective factors, associated outcomes and systematic reviews of effectiveness \n22 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \nIn a US-based meta-analysis, Anderson \n(1996) evaluated the relative \neffectiveness of cognitive interventions \nand found that the average effect was \npositive. In a German and UK meta-\nanalysis of 136 studies, Beelman and \nLösel (2006) evaluated the relative \neffectiveness of social skills training for \npreventing and treating behavioural \nproblems in childhood and adolescence. \nThey found that intensive Cognitive \nBehavioural Therapy programmes \n(interventions that focus on enabling an \nindividual to understand and manage \ntheir own behaviour and relationships \nwith others) were most effective when \ntreating anti-social behaviour and social \ncompetence, especially when delivered \nby authors, project staff, or supervised \nstudents, rather than teachers or other \npsychosocial practitioners.  \nA UK -based review and meta-analysis by \nNewman et al (2007) found that pre-\nsentencing diversion that included \npersonal skills training plus other \nelements (for example reparation to the \ncommunity), were more effective than \ncaution and monitoring alone. \nA US -based review and meta-analysis of \n28 US studies evaluated the effectiveness \nof „wilderness challenge‟ programmes \n(Wilson and Lipsey 2000).  These \nprogrammes had both a physical \nchallenge element and an interpersonal \nelement.  They found a modest positive \neffect of the interventions on reduction \nin re-offending. They suggest that longer \nprogrammes and/or programmes with \ngreater „treatment‟ (as opposed to \npersonal challenge) elements may be \nmore effective. \nFisher et al (2008) reviewed cognitive-\nbehavioural interventions aimed at \npreventing youth gang involvement for \nchildren and young people aged 7-16. The \nresearchers based their review on the \nwell documented relationship between \ngang membership and involvement in \ncrime.  Their main outcomes of interest \nwere gang membership status and \nconvictions for gang-related offences. \nSecondary outcomes included other forms \nof “delinquent” behaviour, drug abuse, \ntruancy, school attainment and \nemployment status. The authors \nidentified several evaluations of \"gang \nresistance education and training\" but all \nwere excluded from the review due to \nmethodological weaknesses. They were \nunable to find any evidence from \nrandomised controlled trials, or quasi-\nrandomized controlled trials, about the \neffectiveness of cognitive-behavioural \ninterventions for gang prevention. They \nconclude that there is an urgent need for \nprimary research in this area.    \nTreatments for sex offenders   \nA US -based review and meta-analysis of 9 \nstudies evaluated treatments for juvenile \nsex offenders (Reitzel et al 2006). \nTreatments included interventions using \ncognitive, behavioural, psychological and \nmultisystemic therapies. They found a \npositive effect on reducing re-offending. \nThe authors state that the quality of the \nincluded studies is such that caution is \nneed in interpreting this result. \nDrug therapy \nIn a US-based meta-analysis, Anderson \n(1996) evaluated the relative \neffectiveness of psychopharmacological \nintervention (i.e. the use of lithium \ncarbonate and the use of stimulants (e.g., \nmethylphenidate, dextroamphetamine, \nand pemolinel) to treat conduct disorder. \nThe review found that the average effect \nwas positive.  \n \nAversion therapy (‘scared straight’) \nA US-based review of 9 RCTs evaluated  \ninterventions in which 14-19 year olds \nwere taken on a visit to prison to „scare \nthem straight‟(Petrosino et al 2000). They \nfound that the intervention increased the \npercentage of the treatment group \n7    Results: risk and protective factors, associated outcomes and systematic reviews of effectiveness \n23 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \ncommitting new offences anywhere from \n1 percent to 30 percent; i.e. the \nintervention was responsible for an \nincrease in offences and was therefore \nnot effective.  \nOther  \nThe review by Newman et al 2007 found \nlimited or inconsistent evidence of \npositive effects for teen courts compared \nto standard diversion. It also found \ninsufficient evidence for:  \n Psycho-dynamic counselling \ncompared to „normal court \ninterventions‟  \n Multi component diversion \ninterventions for persistent \noffenders or offenders with a \nmixed level of offence severity  \n Supported transition from secure \nincarceration to the community \ncompared to no or limited \nsupport  \n Probation plus sports counselling \ncompared to probation only \n Clinically led violence re-\neducation programmes compared \nto court imposed community \nservice \nA US -based meta analysis of 305 studies \nby Wilson et al (2003) evaluated whether \ninterventions targeting young people aged \n12 to 21 years and measuring delinquent \nor anti-social behaviour as an outcome \nhad different effects for „majority‟ \n(white) and „minority‟ (ethnic minority) \nyouth. The researchers found that \noverall, service programmes were equally \neffective for minority and white \ndelinquents. \nOne other review aimed to evaluate \ninterventions relevant to this outcome \n(Donkoh et al (2006)), but did not find \nany studies that met its criteria for \ninclusion. \n7.3 Drug or alcohol misuse \n7.3.1 Risk factors \nThe family risk factors associated with \nthis outcome are: \n Poor parental supervision and \ndiscipline \n Family conflict \n Family history of problem \nbehaviour \n Parental involvement or attitudes \nthat condone problem behaviour \n Low income and poor housing \n Experience of authority care \nA body of research, largely from the US, \nhas demonstrated that parental attitudes \nto, and their use of, drugs are significant \nfactors in the initiation of adolescent \ndrug use (Hoffmann and Su, 1998). \nSiblings have also been found to be \nsources of drug supply, as well as co-drug \nusers (Needle et al 1986 quoted in the \nYouth Lifestyles Survey 1998/9). Parental \nfactors such as discipline, family \ncohesion, parental substance abuse, \nparental monitoring, sibling drug use, and \nearly life trauma were the strongest \npredictors for drug use when experienced \nin early childhood (3-8) and middle \nchildhood (9-11) (Browne 2007). In a \nreview of 4 studies by Rodger et al (2007) \nfamily breakdown and mode of family \ninteractions were associated with \nsubstance abuse. \nParental attitudes and behaviour towards \nalcohol were strongly indicative of \nchildren‟s attitudes and behaviour \ntowards alcohol, in that the heaviest \ndrinking parents had the heaviest drinking \nchildren and the children whose parents \ndrank frequently were more likely to \ndrink alcohol frequently themselves. \nAmong parents who had never drunk, only \nten percent had children who drank \nfrequently; however, among parents with \n7    Results: risk and protective factors, associated outcomes and systematic reviews of effectiveness \n24 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \nthe highest level of drinking (three or \nmore times a week), 31 percent had \nchildren who drank frequently (Youth \nLifestyle survey 1998/9). \nIn a review of 4 studies by Rodger et al \n(2007) deprivation was found to be a risk \nfactor associated with substance abuse; \non the other hand, the Home Office found \nonly a moderate risk effect on alcohol \nconsumption if experienced from early \nchildhood to adolescence (Browne 2007). \nThe school risk factors associated with \nthis outcome are: \n Low achievement at school \n Lack of commitment including \ntruancy \n School exclusions \nSeveral studies identified disrupted \nschooling as a possible cause and effect \nof alcohol and substance misuse. This \nincluded truancy, absences and exclusions \nand this was often associated with other \nproblem behaviours, such as crime and \ndelinquency. (Browne G 2007, Meltzer et \nal 2004, Rodger et al 2007). \nThe Home office report by Goulden and \nSondhi (2001) found that problems in \nschool, such as with school rules, \nattainment, and truancy, had a strong \neffect on future substance abuse when \nexperienced during middle childhood (9-\n11) and adolescence (12-18). Drug use \nwas significantly higher for regular \ntruants compared to young people \nroutinely attending school; female \ntruants and excludees were more likely \nthan male truants to be taking drugs \n(Goulden and Sondhi 2001). \nCommunity risk factors are: \n Availability of drugs \nSeveral of the studies identify the \navailability of drugs in the neighbourhood \nas a risk factor for young people to be \ndrawn into substance abuse, by increasing \nthe chance of exposure to drug using \ngroups, or by being targeted as new \nconsumers (Browne 2007, Rodger et al \n2007, Goulden and Sondhi 2001). \nIndividual risk factors are: \n Personal attitudes condoning \nproblem behaviour \n Friends involved in problem \nbehaviour \n Cognitive function and mental \nhealth \n Age \n Gender \n Ethnic background \nIn their review of 4 studies, Rodger et al \n(2007) found some evidence that a young \nperson‟s attitudes towards drug abuse \ncontributed to the likelihood that the \nyoung person would take drugs \nthemselves, and a Home Office paper \nfound that hedonistic attitudes were also \na contributory factor (Browne 2007). \nPeer involvement in substance abuse was \na strong risk factor when experienced \nduring adolescence (Home Office 2007) \nand several other studies found that \nfriends‟ involvement in substance abuse \nincreased exposure to attitudes \ncondoning drug taking as well as \nincreased availability, greatly increasing \nthe likelihood of a young person taking \ndrugs or alcohol themselves (Flood-Page \net al 2000, Rodger et al 2007, Browne \n2007). \nBoth the Rodger et al study (2007) and \nthe Home Office study 47 (Browne 2007) \nidentified poor self-esteem and \ndepression as risk factors for young \npeople taking drugs and abusing alcohol. \nRodger et al also found that having a \ngenetic predisposition to addiction or \nhaving a special educational needs \n7    Results: risk and protective factors, associated outcomes and systematic reviews of effectiveness \n25 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \nstatement was also common to young \npeople who took drugs or drank alcohol. \nThe Home Office study (Browne 2007) \nfound that other psychological traits, \nsuch as: hedonism, ADHD, and employing \naggressive behaviour to solve problems \nwere all strongly associated with \nsubstance abuse when experienced in \nadolescence. Related to mental states, \n„reasons for getting intoxicated‟ was \nlisted as a separate risk factor in the \nHome Office report, and young people \nwho gave reasons such as wanting to take \ndrugs to get intoxicated and wanting to \nescape negative moods was a strong risk \nfactor in adolescence. \nGender was found to be a risk factor by \nRodger et al (2007) and in the Youth \nLifestyles Survey (Flood-Page et al 2000). \nFemale truants were more likely than \nmale truants to report finding it easy to \nobtain drugs. Females at the margins of \nsociety, e.g. young female offenders or \nexcludes, were more likely than their \nmale counterparts to report drug use.  \nRelated to alcohol use, females were \nmore likely than males to report drinking \nalcohol frequently or binge drinking \n(Anderson, 2001). \nThe following were found to be \nprotective factors against substance \nabuse: \n Healthy standards set by parent, \nteachers and community leaders \n Opportunities for involvement in \nfamilies, school and community \n Social and learning skills to \nenable participation \nIn the Home Office report number 47 \n(Browne 2007) the following were found \nto be characteristics of resilient \nadolescents: knowledge of the negative \nconsequences of drug taking, not \nconsidering drugs to be part of their \nlifestyle, not being exposed to drugs, \nadhering to conventional values, \ninvolvement in religious or sporting \nactivities, having strategies for resisting \npressures to use drugs and /or having \npositive future plans. These \ncharacteristics were strongly protective \nin adolescence (Home Office 2007). \n7.3.2 Systematic Reviews \nThe reviews in this section are \ncharacterised by the multi-component \nnature of the interventions they contain. \nThey do not easily lend themselves to \ncategorising in terms of intervention level \nand might be delivered in schools or the \ncommunity and have components that \ninvolve family therapy as well. The \nreviews fall into two main areas: those \nthat report outcomes on drug misuse \n(seven) and those concerned with alcohol \nmisuse (four). \nDrug misuse \nIn a UK -based systematic review of 18 \nstudies, Elliott (2002) evaluated the \neffectiveness of drug services in reducing \ndrug use, reducing harms associated with \ndrug use, improving family and social \nrelations of young drug users and \nencouraging the uptake of other health \nand social services. They found that \nbehaviour therapy, culturally sensitive \ncounselling, family therapy, and the 12-\nstep Minnesota programmes were most \nsuccessful in reducing drug use, whilst \nfamily therapy was most successful in \nreducing psychological problems of young \ndrug users. Interventions that were most \nsuccessful in improving family and social \noutcomes were family therapy, family \nteaching, non-hospital day programmes, \nresidential care services, and school life \nskills interventions. \n7    Results: risk and protective factors, associated outcomes and systematic reviews of effectiveness \n26 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \nFamily therapy, as defined by Stanton \nand Shadish (1997), is a distinct concept \ndiffering from other family intervention \nprocesses in that it aims to draw in all \nrelevant family members either \nindividually or in a group. It employs \ntherapeutic approaches aimed at altering \nfamily structure and/or family \ninteractions and may include \nmultisystemic, multidimensional \ninterventions from external agencies. \nWhite and Pitts (1998) conducted a \nsystematic review to assess the \neffectiveness of interventions directed at \nthe prevention or reduction in the use of \nillicit substances by young people, or at \nreducing the harm caused by their \ncontinuing use.   Many of the studies \nthey found were evaluations of \ninterventions introduced in schools that \ntargeted alcohol, tobacco and marijuana \nsimultaneously.  Meta-analyses showed \nthat whilst exposure to drug education \nwas associated with lower drug use, the \ninterventions had only a small impact and \nthe gains dissipated over time. \nIn another UK-based systematic review of \n16 studies, Becker and Roe (2005) \nevaluated interventions to reduce drug \nuse in vulnerable or high-risk young \npeople. They found that universal, \nschool-based life skills training \nprogrammes have some success in \npreventing drug use in high risk \nsubgroups, but more so when targeted \ninterventions are nested within the \nuniversal programmes. The intensive \nmulti-component Children at Risk \nprogramme produced positive results (this \ncomprised integrated services co-\nordinated by a case manager, including \nparenting support and educational \nservices, after-school and summer \nactivities and community policing). One \nincluded intervention, the Logan Square \nPrevention Project, carried out by Godley \nand Velasquez (1998) had a harmful \neffect. This study evaluated a programme \nthat included life-skills training, \ncounselling and after-school activities \nprovided, by a number of different \nagencies. The evaluation found that those \nwho had received the intervention had \nincreased their use of marijuana; Becker \nand Roe suggested this was due to high \nstudent turnover and subsequent \nreduction in intensity. \nSuccessful interventions found by Elliott \net al (2005) in reducing further drug use \nin young drug users are: behaviour \ntherapy, culturally sensitive counselling \nin residential settings, family therapy, \nMinnesota 12-step programmes, \nresidential care, and general treatment \nprogrammes. Programmes that are \nsuccessful in addressing the associated \nproblems with drug use are: behaviour \ntherapy, family therapy, school \ninterventions particularly life-skills \ninterventions, residential care, and non-\nhospital day programmes. \nIn a US-based meta-analysis of 18 studies, \nVaughn and Howard (2004) evaluated the \noutcome findings and methodological \ncharacteristics of controlled evaluations \nThe Minnesota Model is characterised by its focus \non abstinence and its multi-method therapeutic \napproach. Combining an initial intensive in-\npatient phase with an assessment of the patient \n(or client, as they are often referred to) by a \nrange of professionals at the start of the \nprogramme. This team of multidisciplinary \nprofessionals combine their assessments to create \nan individualised treatment plan, which includes \nindividual counselling, group therapy, medication \nfor co-morbid conditions, family therapy, \nschooling and recreational programming. The 12-\nstep philosophy leans on other step models, \nnotably the Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) step \nsystem. The rationale of the Minnesota Model is \nbased on changing the patient's beliefs about his \nor her relationship with themselves and others. \nThis change in perspective is brought about \ngradually through habit-breaking and new habit-\nforming, as well as self reflection and group \naffiliation. The in-patient period of 4-6 weeks is \nfollowed by a variable period of out-patient \nmeetings and appointments.     \n7    Results: risk and protective factors, associated outcomes and systematic reviews of effectiveness \n27 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \nof adolescent substance abuse \ntreatments. They found the highest level \nof effectiveness evidence in \nmultidimensional family therapy and \ncognitive-behavioural group treatment. \nThe authors concluded that, in addition, \nseveral other interventions were effective \nfor treating adolescent substance abuse. \nAll these treatments have similar \ncharacteristics, in that they were psycho-\nsocial in nature, exist within a structured \nframework, and should be appealing to \nsocial work practitioners. \nA more cautionary tale than those above \nis told in a systematic review of 17 \nstudies by Gates et al (2006), who \nevaluated evidence of effectiveness of \ninterventions delivered in non- school \nsettings to prevent drug use in young \npeople. Four types of intervention were \nincluded: motivational interviewing or \nbrief intervention, education or skills \ntraining, family interventions and \nmulticomponent community \ninterventions. They found a lack of \nevidence for effectiveness to prevent or \nreduce drug use across the wide range of \nincluded interventions, although there \nwere possible benefits of motivational \ninterviewing and some family \ninterventions. \nAlcohol misuse \nThe systematic reviews examining \ninterventions to reduce alcohol misuse all \ncome to similar conclusions: that there \nvery few proven effective interventions \nand intervention strategies in this area. \nIn the largest review in this field, a UK-\nbased systematic review of 56 studies, \nFoxcroft et al (2002) evaluated the longer \nterm effectiveness of primary prevention \ninterventions of alcohol misuse, \ncomprising generic drug (including \nalcohol) education programmes, or \nprevention programmes aimed \nspecifically at alcohol. They found that \nthe evidence base was weak for short and \nmedium- term effectiveness and a \nsignificant proportion of evaluations \nshowed signs of ineffectiveness. \nPreviously, Foxcroft et al (1997) had \nevaluated the effectiveness of alcohol \nmisuse prevention programmes for young \npeople. They found that not only were \nvery few studies well designed and \nevaluated (with the exception of some \nschool-based programmes), but also that \nnone of the programmes was convincingly \neffective, except for some limited \ninfluence on self-reporting measures.  \nIn the most recent review in this area, \nWood et al (2006) evaluated US-based \nalcohol abuse intervention studies which \nincluded an element of community \ninvolvement. The authors found limited \neffectiveness for school-based \ninterventions, poor methodological \nquality in the studies included and \nheterogeneity of outcome measures. \nEffect sizes for the outcomes were \nrelatively small, undermining long term \nfollow up value of these interventions. \nFinally, in a relatively small review \ncontaining nine studies, Elder et al (2005) \nevaluated the effectiveness of school-\nbased programmes such as school-based \ninstructional programmes, peer \norganizations, and social norming \ncampaigns, in reducing the number of \nyoung people who drink-drive or ride with \ndrink drivers. Due to the small numbers \nof studies, only one included study \nprovided sufficient evidence to \ndemonstrate that school-based \ninstructional programmes are effective in \nreducing riding with drink drivers, but \ninsufficient evidence regarding their \neffectiveness in reducing drink driving. \n7.4 Teenage pregnancy/ poor \nsexual health \n7.4.1 Risk factors \nThe family risk factors associated with \nunintended pregnancy and poor sexual \nhealth are:  \n7    Results: risk and protective factors, associated outcomes and systematic reviews of effectiveness \n28 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \n Low income and poor housing \n(including family structure and \nsize) \n  Parental attitudes that condone \nproblem behaviour  \n  Family history of problem \nbehaviour  \n Experience of authority care \nFathers‟ social class was correlated with \nrisk of teenage pregnancy in a review of \ntwo studies by Rodger et al (2007). While \nthe First Survey of the UK Millennium \nCohort found that socioeconomic \ndisadvantage was associated with low \nknowledge about sex and contraception, \nit was not associated with expectations of \nsexual intercourse before the age of 16 \n(Hawkes et al 2004).  \nThe school risk factors identified for this \noutcome were: \n Lack of commitment, including \ntruancy.  \n Low achievement, beginning in \nprimary school \nA lack of knowledge about sex was not \nassociated with a dislike of school, but \ndisliking school was associated with \nexpectations about having sex before the \nage of 16. Regular truanting was found to \nbe associated with an increased risk of \nteenage pregnancy, identified from the \nPupil Level Annual Census (PLASC) and \nthe National Pupil Database (NPD) in the \nstudy by Rodger et al (2007). The study \nby Rodger et al (2007) also associated low \nachievement at school with teenage \npregnancy. \nThree individual risk factors were \nidentified for this outcome: \n Cognitive function and mental \nhealth \n Early involvement in problem \nbehaviour \n Ethnicity \n According to the study by Rodger et al \n(2007), people with special educational \nare at an increased risk of teenage \npregnancy. Being from a black or mixed \nethnic background is also an individual \nrisk factor. \nEarly sexual activity and having had \nchildren previously were associated with \nteen pregnancy (Rodger et al 2007), as \nwas being from a black or mixed ethnic \nbackground, identified from the Pupil \nLevel Annual Census (PLASC) and the \nNational Pupil Database (NPD), also in the \nstudy by Rodger et al (2007). \nThe three community risk factors \nassociated with this outcome are  \n Community disorganisation and \nneglect (including lack of suitable \nleisure facilities)  \n Disadvantaged neighbourhoods \n Availability of drugs \nRespondents in the Unequal Entry to \nMotherhood and Unequal Starts in Life: \nEvidence from the First Survey of the UK \nMillennium Cohort were also most likely \nto complain about the quality of the \nneighbourhood.  \nThe UK Millennium Cohort Study (Hawkes \net al 2004) found that the majority of \nthose who started childbearing under the \nage of 21 were living in ethnic or other \ndisadvantaged neighbourhoods, (around 6 \nin 10) compared with around one quarter \nof the two eldest groups (p10). In \naddition, living in an area of child poverty \nor of concentration of ethnic minority \nsettlement was associated with early \nmotherhood as well as a number of \neconomic disadvantages (p.27). \n7    Results: risk and protective factors, associated outcomes and systematic reviews of effectiveness \n29 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \nNo protective factors were identified for \nthis outcome. \n7.4.2 Systematic Reviews \nThe systematic reviews looking at the \neffectiveness of programmes to reduce \nunintended pregnancy and improve young \npeople‟s sexual health fall into three \nmain areas: general sex education, HIV \nprevention and interventions specifically \ntargeting the prevention of unintended \npregnancy. All of the programmes \ndescribed here take place either in the \nschool or the community. There appears \nto be little differentiation in terms of \ntheories of behaviour change that \nunderpin interventions in either setting; \nrather, the more important distinction \nappears to be the purpose of the \nintervention – particularly whether it is \naimed at preventing HIV infection, or at \npreventing unintended pregnancies. \nThe one systematic review that does not \nfall into the categories below is the US-\nbased systematic review of 83 studies \nworldwide carried out by Kirby et al \n(2006). This team evaluated the impact \nof curriculum-based sex and HIV \neducation programmes on sexual risk \nbehaviours, STIs and pregnancy rates. \nThey found that the studies demonstrated \nthat, on the whole, sex and HIV education \nprogrammes did not increase sexual \nbehaviour and a substantial percentage of \nprogrammes significantly decreased one \nor more types of sexual behaviour. They \nfound that “across all 83 studies, 65 \npercent had a statistically significant \nimpact on one or more sexual behaviours \naffecting risk of HIV, other STDs or \npregnancy (p.44). They analysed the \ncharacteristics of effective interventions, \nincluding curriculum development, \ncontent and implementation, but \nconcluded that it was difficult to say \nwhich were the most important \ncharacteristics. The review has a detailed \ndescription of these characteristics which \nthere is not space to reproduce here. \n \nGeneral school-based sex education \nIn a US based meta-analysis of 67 studies, \nSong et al (2000) found that school-based \nsexuality education programmes for \nadolescents contribute to increasing \nsexual knowledge. The effects of school \nsexuality education programmes on six \noutcomes regarding sexual knowledge are \nlarge, with the exception of STD \nknowledge. The outcomes measuring \nfamily life knowledge showed the largest \neffect. \nWhile knowledge does not necessarily \ndirectly translate into behaviour, Moos et \nal (2003) and Oakley et al (1995) - \ndescribed in the next section – found that \nknowledge of contraceptive methods can \nbe associated with their appropriate use. \n \nHIV Prevention \nFive systematic reviews focused on HIV \nprevention: Johnson et al (2003), Moos et \nal (2003), Mullen et al (2002), Oakley et \nal (1995) and Underhill et al (2007). \nJohnson et al (2003) found HIV sexual \nrisk-reduction interventions to be \nefficacious in significantly enhancing \nparticipants‟ skills for sexual risk \ncommunications, skills for condom use, \nthe quantity of sexual risk \nInterventions classified as „behavioural‟ often include \none or more of the following: \n- Increasing interpersonal skills (with \npractice/without practice) such as \ncommunications with sexual partners and within \nthis, for example, condom use negotiation skills.  \n- Increasing perceptions of risk of HIV/AIDS \n(„perceived risk enhancement‟) \n- Increasing technical skills (with practice/without \npractice); this refers to condom use skills rather \nthan condom use. \n- Increasing personal skills \n- Decreasing number of sexual partners or sexual \nfrequency or onset of sexual activity. \n7    Results: risk and protective factors, associated outcomes and systematic reviews of effectiveness \n30 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \ncommunications, and participants‟ \ncondom use. One particular aspect of this \nlatter intervention strategy revealed \nthat, the more time spent in the \nintervention on active condom instruction \nand training, the higher the success rate – \nthough overall results were modest. \nInterventions also reduced sexual \nfrequency. Mullen et al (2002) found that \nbehavioural and social interventions on \nthe sexual risk of HIV had a significant \nprotective effect on sexually experienced \nadolescents in the US. They identified \nthat more protective outcomes were \nfound in interventions carried out in \ngroups that were ethnically similar. \nIn a US-based systematic review of 13 \nstudies, Moos et al (2003) evaluated the \neffect of behavioural and social \ninterventions on the sexual risk of HIV \namong sexually experienced adolescents \nin the US and the factors associated with \nany variation of outcomes. They found \nthat knowledge of correct contraceptive \nmethods may be positively associated \nwith their appropriate use, but \nreservations about the method itself, \npartner support of the method, and \nwomen's beliefs about their own fertility \nare important determinants of method \nadherence that may attenuate the \nknowledge effect. However, the authors \nalso point out that the quality of the \nexisting research does not provide strong \nguidance for practice recommendations. \nIn a systematic review of 65 studies, \nOakley et al (1995) evaluated the \neffectiveness of different approaches to \npromoting young people's sexual health. \nThey found that only 12 (18 percent) of \nthe 65 outcome evaluations were \nmethodologically sound, and that only \nthree of the 12 sound evaluations \nrecorded interventions that were \neffective in showing an impact on young \npeople's sexual behaviour. The effective \nprogrammes included a sex education \nprogramme delivered to high school \nstudents, a course of AIDS and other \ninformation given to middle and high \nschool students and HIV and AIDS \neducation programmes delivered to \nrunaways at a residential centre. \nThe evidence on abstinence programmes \nshows that they do not work. In a \nsystematic review of sexual abstinence-\nonly programmes for HIV prevention \namong participants in high income \ncountries, Underhill et al (2007), found \nthat these programmes neither increased \nnor decreased sexual risk among youths in \nhigh-income countries. Moreover, Oakley \net al (1995) found one abstinence \nprogramme intervention to have harmful \neffects, with none of the desired changes \nin attitudes or behaviour being achieved. \nMore young men in the intervention group \nthan in the control group claimed to have \ninitiated intercourse by the end of the \nprogramme. \n \nUnintended pregnancy \nWe found four systematic reviews which \ncontained evaluations of interventions to \nreduce unintended pregnancy: DiCenso \n(1995), DiCenso et al (2002), Harden et al \n(2006) and Swann (2003). \nAlba DiCenso has carried out two \nsystematic reviews in this area (1995 and \n2002). In both reviews she found that the \ninterventions being evaluated showed no \neffect in delaying the initiation of sexual \nintercourse, no improvement in the use \nof birth control and, no reduction in \nInterventions in sexual abstinence only \nprogrammes took the form of individual or \ngroup sessions, led by mostly adults (but \nalso peer- led) and varying in length and \nduration. These sessions were sometimes \nsupplemented by videos, pamphlets and \nparent-child homework assignments or \nactivities. One concept featuring \nprominently is social inoculation, where \nstudents practice resisting peer pressure. \n7    Results: risk and protective factors, associated outcomes and systematic reviews of effectiveness \n31 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \npregnancy rates. DiCenso et al (2002) \nfound intervention types aligning to five \nmain categories: sex education classes, \nschool-based clinics, family planning \nclinics, and community-based \nprogrammes.  Intervention purposes \nfocused around either delaying sexual \nintercourse, consistent use of birth \ncontrol or avoiding unintended \npregnancy. Interventions, which were \nusually session-based, took place in \neducator or health professional-led \ngroups, mixed gender, all female or all \nmale, though some interventions involved \npeer led groups. DiCenso et al (2002) also \nnoted that none of the interventions in \ntheir review focused on strategies for \nimproving the quality of sexual \nrelationships. In addition, they found that \nintervening among young men was more \nlikely to result in increases in \npregnancies, rather than decreases. \nHowever, in a U.K.-based review of \nreviews of 22 reviews, Swann et al (2003) \nfound that school-based sex education, \nparticularly linked to contraceptive \nservices, community-based (e.g. family or \nyouth centres) education, development \nand contraceptive services, youth \ndevelopment programmes and family \noutreach programmes were effective in \npreventing pregnancy. They concluded \nthat good antenatal care, home visiting, \nimproving housing for young parents and \ntheir children, parental and psychological \nsupport, clinic-based healthcare \nprogrammes for teenage mothers and \nearly educational interventions for \ndisadvantaged children can improve \nhealth outcomes for mother and child, \nand are cost-effective and may prevent \nor delay repeat pregnancies. In addition, \nsupport for young parents to continue \neducation was found to improve \neducational and employment outcomes. \nIt is notable that Swann et al (2003) and \nDiCenso et al's (2002) results differ from \none another, with Swann finding more \npositive results than DiCenso. In part, this \ncan be explained by the scope of the \nstudies in question. Swann et al carried \nout a broad review of reviews, whereas \nDiCenso is a focused review of primary \nstudies. In addition, while the research \nquestions of the two reviews overlap, \nDiCenso's RCT-only review had the \ngeneral focus of avoiding unplanned \npregnancy, but within this narrowed to \nspecific sub-foci of delaying intercourse \nuse of and birth control methods. In \ncontrast, Swann et al (2003) adopted \nmuch broader inclusion criteria, both in \nterms of study methodology and in \nresearch focus: the main difference \nbetween the two questions is one of a \nbroad 'what works to impact on this \noutcome‟ approach, versus a narrower \nperspective of 'how effectively has a \nspecific intervention worked'. \nPeer-led intervention approaches- where \ninformation, advice and skills in decision-\nmaking and resisting peer pressure are \ndelivered by young people as mediators \nor facilitators are highlighted as a \npromising approach in increasing \ncontraceptive use, according to Swann \n(2003). \nIn a UK-based systematic review, Harden \net al (2006) evaluated interventions that \n1) prevent unintended pregnancies and 2) \nprovide support to teenage parents. They \nfound that early childhood interventions \nand youth development programmes can \nreduce teenage pregnancy rates among \nyoung women but are less successful with \nyoung men. In addition, young people \nwho had received early childhood and \nyouth development interventions did \nbetter at school, had better attitudes to \nschool, and were more likely to be \nemployed and financially independent. \nInterventions to improve young people‟s \nexperiences of school, or to broaden their \nexpectations/aspirations for the future or \nto tackle poor material circumstances and \nprevent unhappy childhoods were \neffective in reducing pregnancy rates \namong young women. \n7    Results: risk and protective factors, associated outcomes and systematic reviews of effectiveness \n32 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \n7.5 Poor outcomes for teenage \nparents and their children \n7.5.1 Risk factors \nThe „family‟ risk factors associated with \nthis outcome were: \n Low income and poor housing  \n Family conflict  \n Kiernan (1995), cited in Swann (2003), \nfound that a teenage mother was more \nlikely to find herself in the middle of \nfamily conflict as a result of reduced \nchoices available to her as a single \nmother with low income. Eighty percent \nof mothers aged under 18 live in someone \nelse‟s household (e.g. their parents‟) and \nteenagers are more likely to have to \nmove house during pregnancy (Botting et \nal, 1998 in Swann et al (2003). \nAlthough there is little information on \nthis group, young fathers are as likely to \nexperience low income and \nunemployment as young mothers. One \nstudy (Long-term Consequences of \nTeenage births for Parents and their \nChildren) puts forward the idea that that \nyoung mothers may have fared worse in \nthe „marriage market‟, as their peers, \nwho had delayed the start of their family, \nwere more likely to be married to more \nsuccessful men in terms of employment \nand education. However, this may ignore \nother factors that may be involved in \nchoosing one‟s mate, which may not be as \nopen a „market‟ as this idea suggests. \nCompared to their peers, teenage parents \nwere certainly more likely to experience \nlow educational attainment  and \nunemployment – as well as being more \nlikely to be in receipt of benefits, and if \nemployed, be on lower incomes (SEU, \n1999, in Swann et al  (2003)). \nIndividual risk factors identified for this \noutcome were: \n Cognitive function and poor \nmental health \nBoth the study by Berthoud et al  „Long-\nterm Consequences of Teenage births for \nParents and their Children‟ (2004), and \nthe HDA review of reviews conducted by \nSwann et al (2003), found poor mental \nhealth to be an individual risk factor for \nteenage parents, a consequence of \nteenage parenthood and a risk factor for \nnegative outcomes for their children. \nSchool risk factors identified for this \noutcome were: \n Low achievement beginning in \nprimary school \n Lack of commitment including \ntruancy  \n School disorganization  \nAccording to Long-term Consequences of \nTeenage births for Parents and their \nChildren, children of teenage mothers \nsuffer as young adults in terms of lower \neducational attainment and a higher risk \nof economic inactivity in later life (HDA \n1996 Education and employment). Young \nmothers were also more likely to: \n Report having  problems at \nschool before they became \npregnant  \n Leave their education incomplete \n Have no qualifications by age 33 \n Be in receipt of benefits  \n Be on lower incomes (if \nemployed) than their peers (SEU, \n1999) \nTeenage mothers from the 1946 birth \ncohort study were, on average, the least \nable academically, unambitious and had \nleft school at the minimal age. \nIn the multi-method study Teenage \nParenthood and Social Exclusion (2007) \nmost teenage mothers interviewed felt \nthat any sex education they had had at \nschool and at home had been inadequate.  \n7    Results: risk and protective factors, associated outcomes and systematic reviews of effectiveness \n33 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \nReports of bullying were not uncommon, \nadding to the picture of schools as being \nperceived as uncongenial places. \nThe single community risk factor \nidentified for this outcome was: \n Disadvantaged neighbourhoods   \nEleven per thousand mothers aged 15-19 \nlived in areas described as „most \nprosperous‟, compared with 43 per \nthousand in those described as „ports and \nindustries‟. Other types of areas with \nabove average birth rates were areas \ncharacterised by „mixed economies‟, \n„manufacturing‟, „coalfields‟ and „inner \nLondon‟. The same pattern was seen for \nthe under- 16s birth rates in 1994-96 \n(Botting et al 1998). \nProtective factors identified for this \noutcome were: \n Strong bonds with family, friends \nand teachers  \n Opportunities for involvement in \nfamilies, school and community  \nA multi-method study by Wiggins et al \n(2005) described the key factors \nassociated with successful teenage \nparenting as: “support from family and \nhaving a positive partner relationship.” \nThe key factors for success relating to \nopportunities for involvement were: \n“developing a career or having \nemployment they liked”. \n7.5.2 Systematic reviews \nSix systematic reviews were located that \naddressed this outcome. They focused on \nthe provision of parenting skills and \nsupport to young parents and also on the \nsocial exclusion that can accompany \nteenage parenthood. Most can therefore \nbe conceptualised as community-based \ninterventions. \nIn the largest UK-based review in this \narea, Harden et al (2006) examined 18 \nstudies that looked what is known about \neffective, appropriate and promising \ninterventions that target the social \nexclusion associated with teenage \npregnancy and parenting, which might \ntherefore have a role to play in \nsupporting teenage parents. They found \nthat the evidence points both to daycare \n(The Abecedarian project) and to \neducation and career development \nprogrammes as promising ways of \nsupporting young parents. Holistic \nsupport programmes also appear to be \nappropriate but have not yet been shown \nto be effective, and thus have not yet \nbeen shown to translate into better \nemployment prospects. Interventions \nusing either welfare sanctions or bonuses, \nor education and career development \nprogrammes resulted in a significant \nincrease in numbers of teenage parents in \neducation or training.  High quality \nprogrammes without sanctions appeared \nto be more effective. \nA more narrowly focused review, in terms \nof its scope, was carried out in the U.K. \nby Coren and Barlow (2001). They \nevaluated the effectiveness of four \nindividual and/or group -based parenting \nprogrammes in improving psychosocial \nand developmental outcomes in teenage \nmothers and their children. They found \nthat these programmes were significantly \neffective in improving in parenting \nknowledge, causing changes in parent \nattitudes to mealtimes, maternal \nOne intervention, which reported significant \nimprovements in parent behaviours, (Coren \nand Barlow 2001) saw adolescent mothers of \nhealthy infants taking part in a one-to-one \nteaching programme based on videotaped \ninstruction. Subjects were then videotaped \nduring structured mother-infant teaching \nepisodes in their homes at 1 and 2 months \nafter birth; the videoed episodes were \nsubsequently assessed by a specially trained \nnursing practitioner who then delivered \nindividualised feedback emphasising \npositive behaviours. \n7    Results: risk and protective factors, associated outcomes and systematic reviews of effectiveness \n34 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \nmealtime communication, and \nimprovement in mother-infant \ninteraction, maternal self-confidence and \nidentity, maternal sensitivity in \ninteraction and improvement in cognitive \ngrowth fostering capacities of the \nmothers.  However, there were no \nsignificant effects on infant outcomes. \nEsther Coren and her colleagues (2003) \nalso conducted a more general review, \nassessing the effectiveness of individual \nand group-based parenting programmes in \nimproving outcomes for teenage mothers \nand their children. The results show that \nparenting programmes can be effective in \nimproving a range of psychosocial and \ndevelopmental outcomes for teenage \nmothers and their children, but the \nconclusions are limited by the small \nnumber of included studies and high \nparticipant drop-out. \nThe two US -based systematic reviews \nhad similar results to the three above. \nAkinbami et al (2001) evaluated the \neffectiveness of four „teen-tot‟ \nprogrammes. They found that the \nprogrammes had moderate success in \nhelping teen mothers continue their \neducation, and in improving teen and \ninfant health over 6 to 18 months, \nalthough their effects on improving \nparenting skills, knowledge of child \ndevelopment and outcomes for child \ndevelopment were disappointing. Their \nmost significant effect was in preventing \nsubsequent pregnancies between 12 and \n24 months postpartum. \nBaytop (2006) conducted a meta-analysis \nof 29 secondary prevention programmes \nfor teenage mothers aimed at improving \nmaternal life course outcomes including \nhealth, education, employment and \nreduced reliance on public assistance \namongst African American teen mothers. \nShe found that these programmes had \nonly a minimal effect on increasing the \nparticipants‟ educational attainment. \nWhilst the analysis included home and \ncommunity -based programmes, they did \nnot include school-based programmes \nbecause none used randomised controlled \ndesigns. The author therefore suggests \nthat large, well-controlled trials are \nneeded to establish the effectiveness of \nschool -based programmes.  \nThe final review found in this area \ncontained 39 studies. Bakermans-\nKranenburg et al. (2005) evaluated the \neffectiveness of early childhood \ninterventions which aim to improve home \nenvironments for mothers with infants of \nless than 54 months. Generally, \ninterventions aimed to optimise the \nparent-child interaction, and/or enhance \nthe child‟s cognitive development. They \nfound that interventions with middle-\nThe Abecedarian Project took place in the \n1970s in North Carolina. A full-time \neducational programme, it provided high \nquality child care from early infancy to the \nage of five, including individualised games \nto stimulate socio-cognitive and emotional \ndevelopment. Follow-ups were carried out \nat ages 8, 12, 15 and 21. A subgroup of \nparticipants (teenage mothers) was also \nfollowed to investigate effects on the \nmother of the child's participation in the \nprogramme. The teenage mothers in this \nstudy were more likely to have finished high \nschool and continued their education, more \nlikely to be self supporting and less likely to \nhave had more children. \n \n \n \n'Teen-Tot' programmes are comprehensive \nclinic-based programmes which provide \naccess to a range of services from parent \nand child health to parenting skills. The \nprogramme design is based on the \nassumption that the 'one-stop shop' nature \nof the broad clinic-based intervention will \nremove some of the common barriers \n(transportation, lack of continuity care, \nlack of case management) and improve \ncommunication between parent and health \nworker, increase trust and simplify access. \n7    Results: risk and protective factors, associated outcomes and systematic reviews of effectiveness \n35 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \nclass, non-adolescent parents showed \nhigher effect sizes than interventions \nwith low-SES or adolescent samples. The \nmost effective interventions comprised a \nlimited number of sessions and were \nhome-based.   \n7.6 16-18 year olds not in \neducation, employment or \ntraining, and low attainment \n7.6.1 Risk factors \nFamily risk factors identified for these \noutcomes were: \n Family conflict \n Family history of problem \nbehaviour  \n Low income and poor housing \n Caring responsibilities \n Experience of authority care \nThree family risk factors were associated \nwith these outcomes in the study by \nRodger et al (2007). Family conflict was \nfound to be predictive of low attainment \nat school, drawn from a review of 3 \nstudies, including families under stress \nand experience of authority care.  Low \nincome, as measured by free school meals \neligibility and other measures of \ndeprivation were also found to be risk \nfactors. Having caring responsibilities \nalso increased a young persons‟ risk of \nlow attainment at school. \nIn a DfES study by Golden et al (2004), \nfamily conflict, neglect, and challenging \nfamily backgrounds were common \nfeatures of these young people‟s lives. \nCaring responsibilities appeared to have \nan impact on the risk of not being in \neducation, employment or training \n(Golden et al 2004, Rodger et al 2007). \nMany young people took responsibility for \nparents‟ problems; 4 percent of young \npeople in the DfES study were formally \n„young carers‟ and many had also \nexperienced bereavement.   \nComing from a family of material \ndisadvantage and educational \nunderperformance was found to be a \ncontributory factor in a lack of knowledge \nof opportunities in further education or \ntraining, as identified in the Scottish \nSchool Leavers‟ Survey (Biggart et al \n2005) and weak family support networks \nwere also found to be a contributory \nfactor in a review of 2 studies by Rodger \net al (2007). Being in authority care or \nleaving it was also found to be a risk \nfactor (Rodger et al 2007; Golden et al \n2004). \nSchool risk factors identified for these \noutcomes were: \n Low achievement at school \n Aggressive behaviour including \nbullying \n Lack of commitment including \ntruancy \n School exclusions \n School disorganisation \nPerhaps unsurprisingly, more school risk \nfactors were associated with low \nattainment at school more than in any \nother of the risk factor groups. In the low \nachievement at school risk factor, \nprevious low attainment was a risk factor \nfor further low attainment (possibly \nsuggesting that low educational \nattainment can become a continuous \nexperience, rather than merely phases of \nlow attainment that students can move in \nand out of). A lack of commitment to \nschool and aggressive behaviour, \nincluding bullying as measured by poor \nattendance and disruptive behaviour \nrespectively, were also found to increase \nthe young person‟s risk of low educational \nattainment (Rodger et al 2007). \n7    Results: risk and protective factors, associated outcomes and systematic reviews of effectiveness \n36 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \nInterviews with young people revealed \nthat negative experiences at school were \na common theme, including experiences \nof conflict with other students such as \nbullying, attitudes and the approach of \nteachers, inappropriate teaching and \nlearning methods. Perhaps related to \nthis, the following were all found to be \nrisk factors: regular truancy; non-\nattendance, particularly if truancy was in \nfinal year of compulsory education, and \nin secondary comprehensive schools \nwithout a sixth form; exclusions and low \nachievement at school (Golden et al \n2004; Payne, 2000; Rodger et al 2007).  \nCommunity risk factors were: \n Disadvantaged neighbourhoods  \nTime in NEET was longer in areas with \nhigher rates of unemployment, for \ninstance, young people in inner London \nwere at greater risk than those in outer \nLondon (Payne, 2000). Three percent of \nthose young people interviewed for the \nGolden et al (2004) study were refugees \nor asylum seekers. \nIndividual risk factors identified for this \noutcome were: \n Alienation and lack of social \ncommitment \n Cognitive function and lack of \nsocial control  \n Gender \n Ethnic background  \nDemographic characteristics associated \nwith this outcome were being male, being \nfrom a black or mixed ethnic minority \nbackground or having additional \neducational needs. Alienation and lack of \nsocial commitment was identified by the \nScottish School Leavers‟ survey (Biggart \net al 2005). \nThe locus of control describes how a \nperson explains underlying causes of \nevents; those with an external locus of \ncontrol are more likely to feel that events \nare determined by chance or fate over \nwhich they have little or no influence.  In \nthe Scottish School Leavers survey, young \npeople interviewed who exhibited a \nstrong external locus of control were \nmore likely to experience unemployment, \nalthough of course such fatalism may be \nbased on real rather than an imagined \nexperience of the labour market. More \nfemales than males expressed a strong \nexternal locus of control, suggesting that \ntheir beliefs of self-determination were \nweaker than their male counterparts. \nFamily and childcare issues, as well as \npersonal problems, were cited by \nsignificant numbers of females in the \nScottish School Leavers Survey with \nalmost four in ten currently looking after \nthe home or children. Young people with \nadditional educational needs and poor \nmental health were at greater risk of this \noutcome (Payne 2000). Being from a \nblack minority ethnic group was also a \nrisk factor (Payne 2000; Rodger et al \n2007). \nNo protective factors were identified for \nthis outcome. \n7.6.2 Systematic reviews \n16-18 year olds not in education, \nemployment or training \nOnly one systematic review was found to \naddress the issue of NEET directly. It is a \nUS -based systematic review of 16 studies \nconducted by Cobb et al (2006), who \nevaluated the effectiveness of cognitive \nbehavioural interventions (CBIs) to reduce \nschool dropout of young people with \ndisabilities. They found that CBIs that \nincluded a behavioural component were \neffective in reducing school drop out and \nthat young people found CBIs relatively \neasy to learn. However, the evidence was \nnot clear on the length of time an \nintervention needed to take to be \neffective. \n7    Results: risk and protective factors, associated outcomes and systematic reviews of effectiveness \n37 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \nLow attainment \nThere are a large number of systematic \nreviews which focus on teaching and \nlearning and attainment. For the purposes \nof this review, we were interested in \nteaching strategies for young people at \nrisk of the other poor TYS outcomes, \nrather than simply reviewing every \nsystematic review which had an \nattainment outcome. Four systematic \nreviews were relevant, all of which were \nbased in the USA. All the interventions \ndescribed are school-based. \nIn a meta-analysis of 47 studies, Lauer et \nal (2004) found statistically significant \neffects of Out of School Time strategies \nin assisting low-achieving or at-risk \nstudents in reading and mathematics. \nLearner centred teacher-student \nrelationships were the focus of a review \nof 119 studies carried out by Cornelius-\nWhite (2007). This meta-analysis found \nthat person-centred (i.e. involving human \nrelationships rather than the quality or \nstyle of instruction in a subject) can \nimprove student outcomes. Person-\ncentred teaching refers to those aspects \nor qualities of teacher actions and \nbehaviours that affect students on a \npersonal level: listening, caring, respect, \nteachers being perceived as honest, \nsensitive, and understanding. \nIn a large meta-analysis of 219 studies, \nWilson (2005) evaluated the effectiveness \nof school-based programmes for \npreventing or reducing aggressive and \ndisruptive behaviour. They found that \nuniversal, selected/indicated, and \ncomprehensive programmes were \ngenerally effective at reducing the more \ncommon types of aggressive behaviour \nseen in schools. Interventions were also \nfound to be effective across modality \ntypes; social skills training, cognitively-\noriented programmes, behavioural \nprogrammes, and counselling.  \nBaytop (2006) found that secondary \nprevention programmes for teenage \nmothers had a minimal effect on \nincreasing educational attainment among \nAfrican American teenagers. The authors \nsuggest this may be due to the method of \nevaluation: the school-based \ninterventions were not randomised, \nwhereas other interventions – e.g. those \nbased in the clinic- and home (such as \nfamily planning counselling and services, \nclinical care, and individual and group \ncounselling) tend to be more robustly \nevaluated. \n7.7 Running away and youth \nhomelessness \n7.7.1 Risk factors \nStudies relating to this outcome were \nmore likely to report risk factors in the \nfamily domain than any other. \nThe family risk factors identified for this \noutcome were: \n Poor parental supervision and \ndiscipline  \n Family conflict \nThe concept of Out of School Time strategies \n(OSTs) encompasses classes, courses, one to \none mentoring and tutoring or other \nenrichment or support activities. OSTs have \nbecome of increasing interest as a way of \ndelivering the mandatory supplementary \neducational services for children from low \nincome families (following the No Child Left \nBehind legislation in the USA). The types, \nprovision, timeframes and goals of OSTs are \nbroad and range from summer school, \nSaturday school to afterschool sessions, with \nan academic, cultural, social, or recreational \nfocus (or a combination of these). \nUltimately, the principle of any OST strategy \nlies in attempting to improve student \nperformance by creating additional time for \ninstruction. \n7    Results: risk and protective factors, associated outcomes and systematic reviews of effectiveness \n38 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \n Parental involvement/ attitudes \ncondoning problem behaviour  \n Family history of problem \nbehaviour including poor mental \nhealth \n Low income and poor housing \n Experience of authority care \nSeveral studies cited family conflict as \nplacing young people at risk of running \naway or becoming homeless. Young \npeople in the Taking Risks study reported \nconstant arguments at home and a \nslightly lower proportion saying that they \nargued frequently. They were also more \nlikely to report parental involvement or \nattitudes condoning problem behaviour, \nsuch as drink or drugs problems as well as \nreporting verbal or physical abuse and \npoor mental health (Bruegel and Smith \n1999). In addition to this theme, previous \nepisodes of running away were predictive \nof future episodes, and were often as a \nresult of escaping abuse or rejection, but \nsadly resulting in a greater risk than non-\nserial runaways of further exploitation \nand abuse or substitutive care (Flood-\nPage et al 2000). Childhood running away \nwas further associated with future \nepisodes of homelessness or sleeping \nrough. Poor supervision and discipline, as \nindicated by Rodger et al (2007), is \nconcerned with a lack of family support \nwith young people at risk of running away \nfrom home. \nLow income and poor housing also \nfeatured as risk factors for this outcome. \nDeprivation was a risk factor identified by \nRodger et al (2007) from the NPD and \nPLASC databases, and households with no \nfull time earner as a proportion of all \nchildren, households living with more \nthan one person a room as a proportion of \nall households, residents in households \nsharing or lacking basic amenities as a \nproportion of all residents in households, \nwere all associated with running away \nand becoming homeless. One-off \nrunaways, who do not travel far and \ngenerally go alone, are also likely to \ncome from poor backgrounds and \nreconstituted families and have a history \nof truanting (Bruegel and Smith 1999). \nYoung people who ran away from home \nwere at risk of being placed in authority \ncare, itself a risk factor for other \nnegative outcomes. In addition to being \nat risk of entering care, the transition \nfrom authority care was identified by \nRodger et al (2007) from a review of 4 \nstudies as a potential time of risk for \nyoung people. Foster care was also found \nto be a risk factor (Bruegel and Smith \n1999). \nThe only school risk factor associated \nidentified for this outcome was: \n  School exclusions \nRodger et al (2007), and a sub-sample of \nthe study with young people vulnerable to \ndrug abuse (Goulden and Sondhi  2001), \nboth reported that being excluded from \nschool is an indicator of future risk of \nrunning away from home or becoming \nhomeless. \nThere were no community risk factors \nidentified for this outcome. \nThe only individual risk factor identified \nfor this outcome was: \n Gender \nThere was a gender differential for youth \nhomelessness, although this may be an \nartefact of reporting. Females were more \nlikely than males to have experienced \nhomelessness by a ratio of three to two. \nThis may be because young males who \nleave home do so permanently and do not \nappear in household surveys. But this \ngender differential has been shown in \nother research into youth homelessness, \nparticularly amongst the young homeless \n(Rugg, 2000: p.5 in Flood-Page et al \n2000). \n7    Results: risk and protective factors, associated outcomes and systematic reviews of effectiveness \n39 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \nNo protective factors were identified for \nthis outcome. \n7.7.2 Systematic reviews \nThere were no systematic reviews which \naddressed this outcome specifically. \nHowever, one review of potential \nrelevance was conducted by Donkoh et al \n(2006). This review aimed to evaluate the \neffectiveness of Independent Living \nProgrammes (ILPs), a varied group of \nprogrammes intended to improve \noutcomes for foster care (looked-after) \nyouth leaving the care system. The \nauthors suggest that a sizeable number of \nyoung people are discharged from care \neach year lacking the life skills or \nresources necessary to succeed \nindependently; they experience much \nhigher rates of homelessness, \nunemployment, dependency on public \nassistance, physical and mental health \nproblems, and involvement with the \ncriminal justice system than the general \npopulation.  Donkoh et al were unable to \nfind any randomised or quasi-randomised \ncontrolled trials assessing the \neffectiveness of ILPs, however they \ndiscuss the results of 18 non-randomised \nstudies. In general, these indicate that \nILPs may improve outcomes for young \npeople leaving care. However, the \nauthors warn that weak methodology \nmakes it difficult to draw any firm or \nreliable inferences for policy and \npractice. The review specifically targeted \nchildren and young people who had been \nin care, but no studies that met their \ninclusion criteria were identified. \n7.8 Poor mental health \n7.8.1 Risk factors \nFamily risk factors identified for this \noutcome were: \n- Poor supervision and discipline  \n- Family conflict \n- Family history of problem \nbehaviour including poor mental \nhealth \n- Low income and poor housing \n- Experience of authority care \nPoor supervision and discipline in the ONS \nstudy of persistence, onset, risk factors \nand outcomes of childhood mental \ndisorders by Meltzer et al (2003) took the \nform of harsh parenting, with young \npeople with mental health problems \nrecalling that they were frequently told \noff.  In the same study, Meltzer et al \n(2003) found that young people living in \nperpetual discord, dysfunctional families \nor having experienced stressful life \nevents were at greater risk of developing \na mental health disorder. Poor \nrelationships and experience of \ndisharmony were identified in a review of \n2 studies by Rodger et al (2007). In a \ndifferent ONS study by Meltzer et al \n(2004) the emphasis was on the mental \nhealth of looked-after young people. \nThey found that “Looked after children \nare thought to be at much greater risk \nthan other children of having an \nattachment disorder. Inhibited \nattachment disorders are characterised \nby marked difficulties with social \ninteractions that are usually attributed to \nearly and severe abuse from „attachment \nfigures‟ such as parents” and may also be \nattributable by changes in primary \ncaregiver in the early years. The onset of \nemotional disorders was more likely \namong young people whose mothers \nexperienced psychological distress. \nThere was a strong relationship between \nlow income and poor housing and the \nonset of poor mental health in young \npeople. The study by Meltzer (2004) \nfound 20 percent of children in families \nwithout a working parent had a mental \ndisorder; more than twice the proportion \namong children with one or both parents \nworking (9 percent and 8 percent. Other \nfactors included downward mobility, \n7    Results: risk and protective factors, associated outcomes and systematic reviews of effectiveness \n40 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \nliving in rented rather than owned \naccommodation, where no parent was \nworking, or where the household changed \nfrom working to non-working. A poor \nphysical environment was also identified \nas a risk factor for poor mental health in \na review of two studies by Rodger et al \n(2007), which may be related to levels of \naffluence generally.  \nChildren from lone parent and cohabiting \ncouple families were approximately twice \nas likely as the children of married \ncouples to have a mental disorder (16 \npercent and 13 percent compared with 7 \npercent). Children living in reconstituted \nfamilies were more likely to have a \nmental disorder than those living in a \nfamily without stepchildren (14 percent \ncompared with 9 percent). Experience of \nauthority care was strongly associated \nwith experience of poor mental health. \nBamford and Wolkind (1988) reported \nthat the risk of psychiatric ill health was \nhighest among children looked after by \nlocal authorities when compared with any \nother group in society (in Meltzer 2004). \nSchool risk factors linked to poor mental \nhealth in young people were: \n- Low achievement in school \n- Lack of commitment including \ntruancy \n- School exclusions \nLow achievement at school was found to \nbe strongly linked to the future onset of \npoor mental health in children in \nauthority care (Meltzer et al 2004). \nChildren with a mental disorder were \nnearly twice as likely as children with no \ndisorder to have marked difficulties with \neach of the three abilities: reading (37 \npercent compared with 19 percent); \nmathematics (35 percent compared with \n20 percent) and spelling (41 percent \ncompared with 24 percent). These young \npeople also reported long absences of a \nweek (30 percent) or more (18 percent) \nfrom school as well as truancy. School \nexclusions may also be a cause and effect \nof childhood mental disorders (Meltzer et \nal 2003). \nOne community risk factor was identified \nfor this outcome: \n Disadvantaged neighbourhood \nThe community risk factor, disadvantaged \nneighbourhood was strongly identified by \nthe ONS study by Meltzer et al (2004) as a \nrisk factor for poor mental health. \n“Children living in areas classed as „Hard \npressed‟ were the most likely to be \nassessed as having a mental disorder (15 \npercent). This proportion was about twice \nas high as that for children living in areas \nclassed as „Wealthy achievers‟ or „Urban \nprosperity‟ (6 percent and 7 percent)” \n(Meltzer 2004). \nThe individual risk factors identified for \nthis outcome were: \n Alienation and lack of social \ncommitment  \n Cognitive function and mental \nhealth \n Gender  \nIndividual risk factors included Alienation \nand lack of social commitment. In a \nreview of 2 qualitative studies by Rodger \net al (2007) feelings of isolation were \nidentified in young people at risk of poor \nmental health. In addition to this, Meltzer \nel al (2004) found that young people in \nauthority care were much more likely \nthan young people in foster care not to \nspend time any with their friends (13 \npercent compared with 3 percent), and \nyoung people with a mental health \ndisorder were four times more likely than \nthose young people without a disorder to \nreport not spending time with their \nfriends, further increasing their sense of \nisolation and exacerbating their risk of \npoor mental health. \n7    Results: risk and protective factors, associated outcomes and systematic reviews of effectiveness \n41 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \nCognitive function and mental health \nwere found to be strongly associated with \npoor mental health in young people \nincluding special learning difficulties, \nconduct order, and additional educational \nneeds. Meltzer et al (2004) found that the \nlargest percentage increase in odds of \nbeing diagnosed with a conduct disorder \nwas to be found in young people with SEN \nstatements although the authors point \nout that it may be that young people with \nconduct disorder are being classified as \nhaving special educational needs, rather \nthan the SEN status leading to the \nconduct disorder (Meltzer 2004). \nGender was also associated with different \nlevels of risk and for different mental \nhealth problems. There was an increased \nrisk of conduct disorder in boys and for \npoor mental more health generally with a \nslightly decreased risk for emotional \ndisorders compared to girls. Amongst \nlooked-after children, Girls were more \nlikely than boys (36 percent compared \nwith 25 percent) to have sought help \nbecause of unhappiness or worry (Meltzer \net al 2003, Meltzer et al 2004, Rodger et \nal 2007). \nThe Meltzer (2004) study found a \nconsistent pattern in the 1999 survey \ndata between the presence of conduct \ndisorders and the number of children in \nthe household, though this may reflect \nsocio-economic characteristics rather \nthan household size per se. (Meltzer et al \n2004).   \nRelating to age, Older children were more \nlikely than younger children in care (38 \npercent compared with 28 percent) to \nhave sought help because of unhappiness \nor worry (Meltzer 2004). \nNo protective factors were identified for \nthis outcome. \n \n \n \n7.8.2 Systematic reviews \nFamily interventions \nThree reviews examining family-level \ninterventions were identified. All three \nfocus on families with children with pre-\nexisting mental health problems \nIn a US -based systematic review of 8 \nstudies, Littell et al (2005) aimed to \nprovide unbiased estimates of the \nimpacts of multisystemic therapy (MST) \non restrictive out-of-home living \narrangements, crime and delinquency, \nand other behavioural and psychosocial \noutcomes for youth and families. The \nconcept behind MST is to identify \nindividual, family, and environmental \nfactors which may contribute to problem \nbehaviour, and change them through \nsessions with therapists and crisis case-\nworkers, in addition to work with school \nand peer groups focusing on cognitive \nand/or behavioural change, \ncommunication skills, parenting skills, \nfamily relations, peer relations, school \nperformance, and/or social networks. \nThe authors concluded that it is not clear \nwhether MST has clinically significant \nadvantages over other services.  \nIn a US -based review of 2 studies, \nBjornstad and Montgomery (2005) aimed \nto determine whether family therapy \n(e.g. training parents and/or modelling \nbehaviours for young people) reduces \nsymptoms of inattention, impulsivity and \nhyperactivity for children with ADHD or \nADD when compared to no treatment or \nstandard treatment. They found that one \nstudy showed no detectable difference \nbetween the efficacy of behavioural \nfamily therapy and treatment as usual in \nthe community and one study only \nmarginally favoured treatment over the \nmedication placebo. \n7    Results: risk and protective factors, associated outcomes and systematic reviews of effectiveness \n42 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \nMacDonald and Turner (2008) conducted a \nreview into the effectiveness of \n„Treatment Foster Care‟ on psychosocial \nand behavioural outcomes for \nchildren and young people with \ncomplex emotional, psychological \nand behavioural needs. TFC is \ndescribed by the authors as a \nfamily-based intervention that aims \nto provide young people with a \ntailored programme designed to \neffect positive changes in their \nlives.  The results of the 5 studies in \nthis review indicate that TFC might \nbe “a promising intervention for \nchildren and youth experiencing \nmental health problems”, but the \nauthors caution that the evidence \nbase is not particularly robust. \nSchool-based interventions \nTwo reviews evaluating school-level \ninterventions were found. The \ninterventions concerned were quite \ndifferent from one another. The \nfirst review included interventions \nteaching stress management skills \nto children, while the second \nevaluated interventions aiming to \nchange teachers‟ interpersonal skills. \nIn a UK- and Holland-based meta-analysis \nof 19 studies, Kraag et al (2006) looked at \nthe effect of school programmes \ntargeting stress management skills in \nschool children. They found that primary \nprevention programmes for schools (i.e. \ninterventions designed specifically to \npromote mental health and reduce the \nincidence of adjustment problems in \ncurrently normal child and adolescent \npopulations) show promising results. \nFindings indicate that although several \nissues have to be resolved, primary \nprevention programmes focusing on \npromoting mental health through school-\nbased stress management training are \nmost likely effective. \nIn a US-based meta-analysis of 119 \nstudies, Cornelius-White J (2007) \nevaluated the effectiveness of learner-\ncentred relationships (see Section 7.6.2 \nfor a description of this type of \nintervention). The author found that \nperson-centred teaching can improve \nstudents‟ self esteem. \nCommunity interventions \nIn a US -based review of 32 studies, Weisz \net al (2006) looked at whether evidence -\nbased therapies (EBT) produce better \noutcomes than the usual care \ninterventions employed in clinical care in \nyouth psychotherapy. They found that \nalthough evidence -based therapies \n(defined as having been included on \npreviously published lists of effective \ntreatments) have a medium effect size \nthis relatively modest magnitude suggests \nthat there is considerable room for \nimprovement for EBTs. The necessarily \nwide range of interventions described \nprevents generalisation or \ncharacterisation.  \nCognitive Behavioural Therapy serves as an umbrella term \nfor a group or individual therapy which combines \ncognitive therapies with behaviour therapies, using \nvarying approaches and treatment strategies. Underlying \nthis concept is the assumption that unwanted thinking \npatterns and behavioural responses are habitualised over \na long period of time. Commonly CBT focuses on altering \nmaladaptive thinking, changing attitudes and modifying \nbehaviour patterns and is delivered in sessions with a \nspecially trained therapist. \nCentral to CBT is a focus on the 'here and now' and on \naltering the way of thinking and feeling in the present. \nTechniques used in CBT to achieve this cognitive \nrestructuring can, amongst others, include teaching social \nproblem solving skills, encouraging self monitoring, \nchallenging negative thoughts and reflection of previously \nunexamined attitudes, Socratic questioning techniques, \nreward plans and exposure tasks to modify avoidance \nbehaviours. A range of strategies can be used to improve \ncoping skills, or alter internalised ineffective coping \nmechanisms, usually involving both physical and mental \nprocesses. \n7    Results: risk and protective factors, associated outcomes and systematic reviews of effectiveness \n43 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \nSocial and cognitive skills interventions \nThere are a large number of studies that \nevaluate the effectiveness of cognitive \nbehavioural therapy (CBT) for various \npurposes. They break down into two \nbroad camps in this review: those that \naim to treat depression and those that \naim specifically to increase self esteem. \nThere may well be considerable overlap \nbetween the two. \nTwo reviews examined the effectiveness \nof CBT for treating depression. In a UK -\nbased systematic review of 10 studies, \nCartwright-Hatton et al (2004) evaluated \nits effectiveness as a treatment for \nanxiety disorders of childhood and \nadolescence. They found that CBT is a \npromising intervention for childhood and \nadolescent anxiety. This is especially true \nwhen the evidence for the efficacy of CBT \nis compared to that which is available for \nalternative approaches. The US -based \nmeta-analysis of 28 studies conducted by \nChu and Harrison (2007) also found that \nCBT is effective as a treatment for \ndepression, as well as anxiety and other \ngeneral functioning outcomes. \nIn addition to the above, in a US -based \nmeta-analysis of 24 studies, Michael et al \n(2002) evaluated the effectiveness of \npsychosocial treatments (such as CBT) \nand pharmacological treatments on \ndepression and depressive symptoms for \n5-18 year olds. They found that both \npsychosocial and pharmacological \ninterventions were more effective for \nadolescents than for children and these \nresults were durable over time (median \n36 weeks) where follow up data were \nreported.   In a more general review than \nthose previously mentioned, Weisz et al \n(2006) found that psychotherapeutic \ntreatments appear to produce significant \nbut modest effects on youth depression. \nUnsurprisingly, CBT is also recommended \nfor increasing young people‟s self esteem. \nWhile the UK-based review by Taylor and \nMontgomery (2007) only contained two \ntrials, they were of good quality and \ncontained a reasonable number of \nparticipants. Taylor and Montgomery \nconcluded that the use of cognitive \nbehavioural therapy for adolescents \nsuffering from unhealthy, low levels of \nself-esteem may be an appropriate and \neffective treatment for increasing global \nand academic self-esteem, although more \nresearch is clearly needed. \nIn a US-based meta-analysis of 64 studies, \nElbaum and Vaughn (2001) looked at the \neffect of school-based interventions on \nself esteem for students with learning \ndisabilities. They found that it was \npossible to increase students‟ academic \nself concept, social self concept and \ngeneral self concept, but not personal \nand physical. Little detail is given of the \ninterventions evaluated, other than broad \ncategorisations: „mediated‟, \n„counselling‟, „academic‟, „physical‟, and \n„self concept‟. \nFinally, physical activity (exercise) has \nalso been trialled to improve both to \ntreat depression, and to improve the self \nesteem of young people. The Norwegian-\nbased review of 23 studies by Ekeland et \nal (2005) found twelve studies indicating \nthat exercise can improve self esteem by \na small, but significant amount. In \nanother Norwegian review (of 16 studies), \nLarun et al (2006) evaluated exercise for \nthe treatment of depression. They found \nthat whilst there appears to be a small \neffect in favour of exercise in reducing \ndepression and anxiety scores in the \ngeneral population of children and \nadolescents, the small number of studies \nincluded and the clinical diversity of \nparticipants, interventions and methods \nof measurement limited their ability to \ndraw conclusions regarding effectiveness.  \nOne additional study, that sought to \nimprove young people‟s social and \ncognitive skills, examined neither \ndepression nor self esteem. In a US -\nbased systematic review of 205 studies, \nDurlak et al (2007) evaluated the impact \n7    Results: risk and protective factors, associated outcomes and systematic reviews of effectiveness \n44 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \nof Positive Youth Development \nprogrammes that target children‟s \npersonal and social competence. They \nfound that the programmes had a \nsignificant effect on variables related to \nSchool setting (psycho-social environment \nof the school and classroom and \nclassroom level change), Family \n(Parenting practices and family \nenvironment), Community (Bonding to \ncommunity adults) and mesosystemic \nchanges (Family-school relationships). \nOne other review aimed to evaluate \ninterventions relevant to this outcome \n(Donkoh et al (2006)), but did not find \nany studies that met its criteria for \ninclusion. \n8    Multi-provider interventions \n45 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \n8 Multi-provider interventions \n \nThe rationale for Targeted Youth Support, \nand this review, is that agencies providing \nservices for vulnerable young people \nwould work better together than they do \nalone, and that this would increase \nefficiency and cost-effectiveness  (DfES \n2007: 4). The population targeted by TYS \nand thus of interest to this review, \ntypically has multiple risk factors, and \nexperience one or more of the outcomes \nof interest to TYS. In order to explore the \neffectiveness of interventions to alleviate \npoor outcomes for this group, reviews \nwhich included explicitly multi-\ncomponent interventions (targeting more \nthan one risk factor and/or outcome) \nwere examined in more detail since these \ninterventions, containing more than one \ncomponent, are likely to require multiple \nproviders and, hence, be of particular \nrelevance to TYS. \nEleven reviews were identified which \nincluded multi-component interventions. \nThese were identified by identifying \nreviews which described interventions \ndelivered by more than one provider, or \nexplicitly involved multiple \ninstitutions/actors in the delivery of the \nintervention. The identification of these \ninterventions was hampered by \nwidespread limited reporting both in the \nprimary studies and the systematic \nreviews. Conclusions are equally difficult \nto draw from the reviews with respect to \nthe impact of these interventions. Those \nidentified are described below divided \ninto sections according to outcome. \nWhere individual programmes are named \nand described from included reviews, \nthese are summarised below to illustrate \nmulti-provider interventions. The amount \nof detail available here reflects the level \nof detail available in the reviews we were \nworking with. \n8.1 Drug or Alcohol Misuse \nBecker and Roe (2005) included several \nstudies with multi-component \ninterventions which focused on drug \nprevention. These included programmes \nwith a range of initiatives (work with \nparents, drug education, outreach, \nrecreation, life-skills training, counselling \nand home visits), residential programmes \nwith educational and vocational training, \nand residential programmes with \ncounselling too. The Children At Risk \n(CAR) programme was also described, \ncomprising integrated services co-\nordinated by a case manager including \nparenting support and educational \nservices, after-school and summer \nactivities and community policing. This \nlast was shown to be effective, and the \nothers had some beneficial effects, with \none harmful intervention. Overall, these \ninterventions were targeted at high-risk \nyoung people (at risk for drug use) in the \nUS, with interventions mainly being \ndelivered in the school setting. High risk \nsub-groups appear to respond better \nwhen targeted interventions are nested \nwithin a universal programme. \nThree other systematic reviews evaluated \ndrug and alcohol use prevention \nprogrammes; Elliott et al (2005) Vaughn \nand Howard (2004) and Foxcroft et al \n(1997). All included studies primarily \nconducted in the US and Canada, \nalthough British, Scandinavian and other \ncountries were represented. This is \nimportant when attempting to generalise \nas the US drug policy is based \npredominately on drug abstinence rather \nthan tackling problems associated with \ndrug use. Similarly, many US \ninterventions are targeted at specific \npopulations, such as African-Americans, \nAsian-Americans, and Latino-Americans, \nwhich are groups less representative of \n8    Multi-provider interventions \n46 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \nthe UK population. Elliot and colleagues \n(2005) described two types of multi-\ncomponent intervention. „Minnesota 12-\nstep‟ interventions are described by \nWilliams and Chang (2000) as short \nhospital inpatient programmes typically \noffering a comprehensive range of \ntreatment consisting of individual \ncounselling, group therapy, medication \nfor co-morbid conditions, family therapy, \nschooling and recreational programming. \nThese showed a positive effect in \nreducing drug re-use. Diverse „school-\nbased programmes‟, for example \ncombining school with afterschool \nfacilities or health centres and other \nextracurricular activities such as sports, \nvoluntary work, and cultural activities \ninvolving parents, peers or health \nprofessions also showed effectiveness, \nparticularly life-skills interventions. \nFoxcroft et al (1997) also found limited \neffectiveness for Life Skills Training (LST) \nintervention, which is a multi-modal drug \neducation programme, although the \nevidence base was weak.  \nVaughn and Howard (2004) included \nstudies whose participants were often \njuvenile offenders, probationers or youths \nreferred by courts, and most participants \nwere in lower socioeconomic groups. The \npredominantly psycho-social interventions \nincluded in order of strength of effect: \nmultidimensional family therapy and \ncognitive behavioural group treatment; \nbehavioural therapy; multisystemic \ntherapy; combined cognitive-behavioural \ntherapy and functional family therapy; \nfamily systems therapy; functional family \ntherapy; combined Botvin life-skills with \nadditive programmes and psycho-\neducational therapy; supportive group \ncounselling; interactional group \ntreatment; aftercare services; residential \ntreatment services; individual \ncounselling; family education; adolescent \ngroup treatment; and individual \ncognitive-behavioural treatment. As can \nbe seen, the interventions which \nattempted to operate within several \nsocial arenas were more successful, with \nthe highest level of effectiveness \nevidence in multidimensional family \ntherapy and cognitive-behavioural group \ntreatment. \n8.2 Poor mental health and anti-\nsocial behaviour \nBjornstad et al (2005) described a \nbehavioural family intervention aiming to \nreduce symptoms of inattention, \nimpulsivity and hyperactivity, which \ntaught parents behavioural skills to use in \nthe home, which were combined with \ntherapist-administered behavioural \ninterventions with the children including \na reward system, time outs, social \nreinforcement, and modelling. This was \nalso based in the US, and was targeted \nspecifically at families with children with \nADD/ADHD, but showed only marginal \ntreatment effect. Durlak et al (2007) had \na theoretical framework which they used \nto synthesise the Positive Youth \nDevelopment programmes that target \nchildren‟s personal and social \ncompetence. This framework explicitly \nemployed the concept of systemic change \nto explore “attempts to change the roles, \nbehaviours, and relationships among \nmembers of one or more social systems.” \nThe programmes were found to have a \nsignificant effect on variables related to \nschool setting (psycho-social environment \nof the school and classroom and \nclassroom level change), family \n(parenting practices and family \nenvironment), community (bonding to \ncommunity adults) and mesosystemic \nchanges (family–school relationships). All \nwere conducted in the US. This lack of \ndetail may reflect the relatively vague \noutcomes. \nLittell et al (2005) targeted children and \nyouth (ages 10-17) with social, emotional, \nand behavioural problems and their \nfamily members, attempting to evaluate \nthe impact of multi-systematic therapy \n(MST) on restrictive out-of-home living \narrangements, crime and delinquency, \n8    Multi-provider interventions \n47 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \nand other behavioural and psychosocial \noutcomes for youth and families. MST \nuses a “family preservation service \ndelivery model” that provides time-\nlimited services (four to six months) to \nthe entire family. Treatment teams \nconsist of professional therapists and \ncrisis caseworkers, who are supervised by \nclinical psychologists or psychiatrists. \nTherapists were mental health \nprofessionals with masters or doctoral \ndegrees; they have small caseloads and \nare available to program participants 24 \nhours a day, seven days a week. \nTreatment is individualized to address \nspecific needs of youth and families, and \nincludes work with other social systems \nincluding schools and peer groups (hence, \nthe name multisystemic). However, MST \nshowed no beneficial effect. \nMST was also evaluated by Woolfenden et \nal (2001). It is probable that some overlap \nhas occurred between these reviews, as \njuveniles with conduct disorder or \ndelinquency were also targeted. Seven of \nthe eight studies were interventions in \nthe US. Significant effects were found for \ntime spent in institutions, risk of being \nrearrested and in the rates of subsequent \narrests, but not risk of incarceration, \npsychosocial outcomes such as family \nfunctioning, or child/adolescent \nbehaviour. \n8.3 Under-18 conceptions  \nTwo multi-component interventions were \ndescribed by DiCenso (2002), both aiming \nto reduce unintended pregnancies \namongst adolescents. The majority of \nparticipants were African American or \nHispanic, thus “over-representing lower \nsocioeconomic groups” and all were from \nthe US. One was an educational \nintervention led by trained peers and \nteachers that included a peer resource \nteam, parent education, and community \nlinkages. The other delivered various \ntailored services including education, skill \nbuilding, counselling, mentoring, \nadvocacy, values and attitudes about \nteen sexual activity and pregnancy, \ncoping skills and goal setting, links to \nfamily planning services, participation in \nsocial or recreational activities, and was \ndelivered by combinations of family \nplanning clinics, schools and other \ncommunity based settings. Neither \nshowed a positive effect. \nHarden et al (2006) also evaluated some \nmulti-component interventions aiming to \nreduce unintended teen pregnancies. Six \nmulti-component interventions were \ndescribed. All were targeted at teenage \ngirls or mothers. According to the \nauthors, “Holistic support programmes \nalso appear to be appropriate but have \nnot yet been shown to be effective. High \nquality programmes without sanctions \nappeared to be more effective than \ninterventions with sanctions.” Details of \nthe multi-component interventions in this \nreview are described below, though more \ninformation is available in the review \nitself. \n Philliber et al (2001) report the \neffects of the Children‟s Aid \nSociety Carrera-Model \nProgramme, a multi-component \ncommunity-based intervention. \nThe programme included work \nexperience, careers advice, \nacademic support, sex education, \narts workshops, and sports; \noutcomes were measured after \nthree years and young people in \nthe control group received no \nintervention. The results were \nstatistically significantly in favour \nof the intervention group. The \nstudy took place in 12 sites in six \nAmerican cities during the 1990s. \nResearchers recruited 1,163 \nparticipants aged 13 to 15; study \nparticipants came from several \ndifferent ethnic backgrounds and \nmainly from families with low \nSES. \n Hahn et al (1994) report the \neffects of the Quantum \n8    Multi-provider interventions \n48 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \nOpportunities Programme (QOP). \nThis intervention includes \ncommunity service, educational \nsupport, and social development \nworkshops, and is aimed at \nimproving academic achievement \nand social skills. Participants \nwere followed up one year after \nthe end of the programme. Young \npeople in the control group \nreceived no intervention. The \nintervention lasted for four school \nyears and took place in the 1980s \nand 1990s. Researchers recruited \n250 US high-school students aged \n13 to 17; 76 percent were black \nand all were from families on \nbenefits. While the results \nsuggested that the intervention \nreduced the birth rate by 36 \npercent, it was of borderline \nstatistical significance. \n Cave et al (1993) report the \neffects on teenage mothers of \nJobstart, a multi-component \neducation and employment \nintervention aiming to increase \nthe rate of employment and \nearnings for young people who \nhave dropped out of school. \nTeenage mothers in the control \ngroup did not receive an \nintervention. They were followed \nup four years after the start of \nthe intervention. The \nintervention took place between \n1985 and 1988 in the USA. \nResearchers recruited 2,312 \nparticipants aged 17 to 21, mostly \nfrom ethic minorities, and \nincluding 508 teenage mothers. \nThis study found that the \nintervention was able to improve \neducational attainment, but only \nsites with a clear focus on long-\nterm self sufficiency were able to \nimprove mothers‟ employment \nprospects. The intervention had \nno impact on rates of repeat \npregnancies. \n Field et al (1982) report the \neffects of daycare provision and a \nprofessional training intervention \naiming to improve rates of \nemployment and school \nattendance among teenage \nmothers. The intervention took \nplace in the late 1970s in Miami, \nUSA among 120 black teenage \nmothers aged 13 to 19 from \nfamilies with low socio-economic \nstatus. Teenage mothers in the \ncontrol group did not receive an \nintervention. Participants were \nfollowed up for two years after \nthe start of the intervention. This \nintervention showed beneficial \neffects for education and \ntraining, though was less clear \nwith regards to its impact on \nrepeated pregnancies. \n Gathron (1990) reports the \neffects of a multi-component \neducation, employment and \nsocial support intervention aiming \nto reduce the negative outcomes \nassociated with teenage \nparenting, such as school \ndropout, unemployment and low \nself-esteem. Teenage mothers in \nthe control school did not receive \nan intervention. Outcomes were \nmeasured after 25 months. The \nstudy took place at two rural \nschools in the USA in the 1980s. \nResearchers recruited 66 \npregnant African-American \nteenagers aged 16–18 and 8–28 \nweeks pregnant. The results \nshowed that the intervention \nreduced repeat pregnancies, was \nresponsible for a large \nimprovement in education \noutcomes, but had less impact on \nemotional wellbeing. \n Quint et al (1997) report the \neffects of New Chance, a multi-\ncomponent education and \ntraining programme for teenage \n8    Multi-provider interventions \n49 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \nmothers who had dropped out of \nschool that aimed to help them \nfind employment. Teenage \nmothers in the comparison sites \ndid not receive an intervention. \nThey were followed up for three \nand a half years after the start of \nthe intervention. Researchers \nrecruited a total of 2,322 young \nmothers at 16 different sites in \nthe USA in 1989. Participants \nwere, on average, 19 years old at \nthe start of the study, were from \ndisadvantaged communities, and \nthe majority were from ethnic \nminorities. The intervention was \nable to improve young mothers‟ \neducational attainment but not \ntheir emotional wellbeing. \n8.4 Therapeutic foster care \nThis is described by Hahn et al (2005) as \ninterventions in which “Youth who cannot \nlive at home are placed in a foster home \nin which foster parents are trained to \nprovide a structured environment for \nlearning social and emotional skills. Youth \nin the programme are monitored at \nhome, in school and in leisure activity; \nprogramme personnel work closely with \nfoster parents and may collaborate with \nteachers, probation officers, employers \nand others in the youth‟s environment to \nensure prosocial learning and behaviour.” \nAll included studies in this review were \nUS, universal school-based programmes \ntargeting young people or areas at risk. A \nsignificant decrease in violent or \naggressive behaviour was found, and the \nintervention was shown to be cost-\neffective, although less beneficial for \ngirls than for boys. \n8.5 Youth Offending \nNewman et al (2007) reviewed the \nevidence for interventions to reduce \njuvenile offending, including \ninterventions that contained multiple \ncomponents. Offenders were defined as \nindividuals under the care of the Criminal \n(or juvenile) Justice System at the time \nof the study, aged 10-17.  This included \nindividuals on parole, probation, in jail or \nin any other secure detention setting.   \nMulti-component interventions were \ndivided by the authors of the review into \nthose which targeted first time offenders \nand those which targeted persistent or \nmixed groups of offence severity. The \nreview authors found consistent evidence \nof a positive effect for multi-component \ninterventions when compared with \nstandard diversion for first time offenders \ni.e. lower rates of re-offending for multi-\ncomponent interventions.  They found \ninsufficient evidence about their effect \nfor persistent or mixed groups of \noffenders. \nMulti-dimensional Treatment Foster Care \n(MTFC) can also be considered to be a \nmulti-component intervention. The \nauthors found consistent evidence of \npositive effect For MTFC compared to \n„standard residential care for female \noffenders but inconsistent evidence of \neffect for male offenders. \n8.6 Implications \nMulti-component interventions identified \nwithin this review do not show any \ndefinite patterns. This may be due to the \nreporting issues discussed in the \nintroduction to this section. Another \nfactor contributing to this is the \nheterogeneity of outcomes and \npopulations, study designs and \ncomponents. Similarly, systematic \nreviews may choose to examine a \npopulation, or interventions to alleviate a \ncertain outcome or risk factor (e.g. \nunintended teenage pregnancy, juvenile \noffending). Alternatively they may \nspecifically examine the processes and \neffectiveness of a type of intervention \n(e.g. therapeutic foster care). This gives \nrise to very different types of review, \nwhich hinders meaningful meta-synthesis. \nHowever, the majority of the multi-\n8    Multi-provider interventions \n50 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \ncomponent interventions appear to show \nbeneficial effects.  \nA systematic review of multi-component \nor multi-provider interventions may prove \nmore useful. A sustained and systematic \nexamination of the theoretical and \nlogistic barriers to implementing multi-\ncomponent interventions and their impact \ncould be used to inform policy in a range \nof areas and promote cross-sector \nworking by examining the findings and \noutcomes of multi-component \ninterventions.  While some interventions \nhave been briefly described above, a \nsystematic review would allow and \nanalysis of why and which multi-\ncomponent interventions are more \neffective. \n9    Discussion of cross-cutting themes \n51 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \n9 Discussion of cross-cutting themes \n \nOur analysis thus far has been structured \naccording to the outcomes targeted by \nTYS. In order to examine themes across \nthe outcome areas, patterns within the \nresearch were examined in three ways: \n1. Identifying the intervention \ntypes for the systematic reviews \nwithin each outcome area (see \nAppendix E for further details). \nThese were combined with the \nfindings from the consultation \nwith the expert panel on April 3rd \nto form conclusions, and \nrecommendations (see Chapter \n11) \n2. Exploring the number and type of \nrisk factors identified at each of \nthe four levels (individual/peer, \nfamily, school and community) \ntargeted by reviews for each \noutcome area. \n3. Examining the patterns of \nresearch revealed by comparing \nthese.  \nEach review was mapped against the \nknown risk factors from Component 1. If \nthe review mentioned specifically that an \nincluded intervention aimed to change an \noutcome similar to the risk factors, or \ntargeted a population defined by the risk \nfactors, it was considered to be \nevaluating relevant evidence. By \ncomparing the known risk factors for this \noutcome with the outcomes studies \nprofessed to target, it has been possible \nto identify patterns in the available \nresearch. These may reflect: \n Policy and funding priorities; \n(policymakers may be required to \nfocus on a particular population, \nwhich effects where funding \nresources are distributed) \n Practical or logistic concerns; \n(e.g. it may be easier to research \nand implement interventions in \nschools due to the captive \naudience and the relatively good \nchance of retaining participants \nover a reasonable follow-up \nperiod: therefore more research \nmay be carried out in this setting) \n Current beliefs about theories of \nbehaviour; (e.g. individual versus \ncommunity models) \n Publishing bias; journals may \nreflect fashionable theories, or \nmay only publish positive results.   \n Ease of evaluation and \nimplementation; (it is easier to \ntarget individuals and families \nthan carrying out a high-quality \nevaluation of a large-scale change \nin local structural environment.) \n9.1 Intervention types   \nAssessment of the relationship between \nrisk factor and outcome, and methods of \nevaluation, was often poorly discussed in \nthe reviews, especially modelling of the \nrisk pathways and outcomes. Such \ninformation would enhance the usefulness \nof such research to policy-makers. Long-\nterm follow-ups were rarely identified, \nand would add considerably to the \nusefulness of evaluations in this area, as \nwould greater detail about the content \nand implementation of interventions.  \nThe Expert Panel considered that \ninformation about duration, length of \ntime to follow-up, content, theory and \npopulation should be consistently \nreported by evaluations of interventions \nto facilitate the use of this research. \nMoreover, more reporting of inconsistent \n9    Discussion of cross-cutting themes \n52 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \nresults and negative or null findings \nwould assist policymakers and other users \nof research. This would also reinforce the \nmessage that some interventions can be \nharmful, as discussed later in this report \n(see Chapter 10). \n9.1.1 Youth Offending and Anti-social \nbehaviour \nNineteen reviews were found which \nevaluated interventions in this area \ncovering: \n Parenting and family therapy-\nbased interventions \n School-based violence reduction \nprogrammes  \n Community-based residential \nplacement/ foster care   \n Social and cognitive skills \ninterventions \nTwo additional reviews which did not \nreadily fit into one of the previous \ncategories, focused on specific \nintervention or populations. Reitzel et al \n(2006) examined cognitive, behavioural, \npsychological and multisystemic therapies \nfor juvenile sex offenders. Anderson \n(1996) evaluated a \npsychopharmacological intervention to \ntreat conduct disorder. \nThese interventions focus primarily on \nindividual or family behaviour change. \nThis suggests that there is a research gap \nabout of the effectiveness of \ninterventions which target the \ncommunity, or built/structural \nenvironment, although these are known \nrisk factors. \nMoreover, the Expert Panel considered \nthat engagement with society and \ncommunity is an appropriate approach to \ntake in targeting youth offending. More \nand/or better quality evaluative research \nto identify what fosters engagement \nwould be welcomed, as would services-\nbased research which asks questions \nabout the personalisation of services, \nflexibility and workplace development of \nlocal practitioners and agencies, and \nneeds-based delivery. These \nrecommendations are offered with the \nunderstanding that the answers are likely \nto differ considerably for different \ngroups. \n9.1.2 Drug/Alcohol Misuse \nEleven reviews were identified which \ntargeted this outcome. Many of these \nreviews included multi-component \ninterventions.  A range of settings were \nused, based in the school, community, or \nfamily. Virtually all operate at the \nindividual or family level. They were \ngrouped into reviews which either \nspecifically targeted drug misuse, or \ntargeted alcohol misuse. Several multi-\ncomponent interventions were included, \nand have been discussed in Section 8.  \nWhilst effective interventions were \nidentified in the reviews, the Expert \nPanel considered that addressing \nadditional contextual factors and service \ndelivery would improve drug- and alcohol- \nrelated outcomes, both in research in \npractice. Exploring parental attitudes \nwhich condone alcohol and drug use by \ntheir children could usefully inform \nresearch and practice in this area. \nSimilarly, investigating young people‟s \nreasons and motivation for behaviour \nchange, combined with early \nidentification of those at risk would be \nvaluable. Interventions which promoted \nempowerment or a sense of belonging \namongst young people were felt to be of \ninterest for future research. \nSeveral of these interventions were set \nwithin school. This was felt by the Expert \nPanel to be of relevance to suggestions \nabout service delivery. Peer-led \ninterventions were proposed as a subject \nfor future research, as were initiatives to \nimprove teacher training. A skilled \nworkforce, and efficient referral of at-\nrisk individuals, would ease connections \nbetween youth services organisations. \n9    Discussion of cross-cutting themes \n53 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \n9.1.3 Teen pregnancy and poor sexual \nhealth \nEleven reviews about under-18 \nconceptions or poor sexual health were \nfound. The systematic reviews looking at \nthe effectiveness of programmes to \nreduce unintended pregnancy and \nimprove young people‟s sexual health fell \ninto three main areas:  \n General sex education \n HIV prevention  \n Prevention of unintended \npregnancy \nAll of the programmes were set either in \nthe school or the community. There \nappears to be little distinction made in \nterms of theories of behaviour change \nthat underpin interventions in either \nsetting, rather, the more important \ndistinction appears to be the purpose of \nthe intervention – particularly whether it \nis aimed at preventing HIV infection, or \nunintended pregnancies. Most \ninterventions were targeted at teenage \nmothers, but not specifically at groups \nwithin this population. \nThe difficulty in teasing out the \nmechanisms by which the included \ninterventions attempted to affect change \nwas reflected in the questions raised by \nthe Expert Panel. While the systematic \nreviews provided useful information, \nmore detailed descriptions about the \ninterventions and the various sub groups \n(age groups, components of intervention, \nhow they attempted to bring about \nchange) would enable more effective \nimplementation of evidence-based policy \nand practice. It was also suggested that \nunderstanding people‟s choices and \nbehaviour motivations (which evolve as \nsociety does) would assist in designing \nappropriate and effective interventions, \nand more importantly, in replicating \npositive behaviours. The expert panel felt \nthat it is important to be aware that \ninterventions based on individual \nbehaviour or attitude change are limited \nin their scope, and do not account for \nfactors such as financial or local \nenvironmental influences. \n9.1.4 Poor outcomes for teenage \nparents and their children  \nThe interventions, from six systematic \nreviews, which targeted these poor \noutcomes tended to be community-based \nand focus on providing parenting skills \nand support to young parents and also the \nsocial exclusion that can accompany \nteenage parenthood. They operated at \nthe individual and community levels, \nfurther evidence that the overwhelming \nmajority of interventions try to affect \npeople‟s behaviour and choices, rather \nthan remove macro- risk factors such as \npoor housing, poverty, and \nunemployment. Targeting was not a \nfeature of included interventions; more \nresearch on who would benefit from \ninterventions and how to get them into \nthe services, on hard-to-reach groups \n(with attendant recognition of increased \nneed for programme funding, monitoring \nand performance measures) was \nsuggested by the Expert Panel. Research \nalso needs to look at outcomes (e.g. \nwork, education, quality of life) for \nparents as themselves; not just parents as \nvessels for their children‟s development. \n9.1.5 NEET and Low attainment \nThe only systematic review which \naddressed NEET directly employed \ncognitive behavioural therapy (to prevent \nschool dropouts), which again operates at \nan individual behavioural/attitudinal \nlevel. This was discussed together with \nthe six reviews which targeted low \nattainment, which included interventions \nsuch as person-centred teaching, and \nyouth development programmes, with the \ncaveat that it is recognised that NEET and \nlow attainment have different histories \nand risk factors. All the interventions \ndescribed for this outcome are school–\nbased. \n9    Discussion of cross-cutting themes \n54 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \nThese results, discussed in detail above, \nunderlined, for the expert panel, the \nimportance of understanding transition \nissues from primary to secondary school, \nand life transitions such as change in \nfamily structure, or out of the home \nenvironment. Better information about \nthe relationships between underlying risk \nfactors would assist in forming and \ndelivering appropriate measures. \n9.1.6 Youth homelessness and running \naway \nNo evidence about interventions was \nidentified for this section, and expert \ncomments could not therefore be \nsolicited. \n9.1.7 Mental health \nThe sixteen systematic reviews which \nevaluated interventions to improve \nmental health outcomes tended to \noperate at the individual or family levels. \nSchool, family and community settings \nwere used.  \nThe interventions clustered around four \ntypes: \n School-based interventions \n Family intervention  \n Community interventions \n Social and cognitive skills \ninterventions \nThese all appear to attempt to change an \nindividual‟s attitudes.  It is interesting to \nnote that almost no research has been \nconducted on the effect of the built \nenvironment, or exercise, for example. \nEkeland (2005) for example, found a \npositive effect on self-esteem with \nexercise intervention for schoolchildren.  \nThis may reflect the broad conception of \n„mental health‟ used in this review.  \nHaving more focused definitions would \nenable both more in-depth analysis, and \nimproved clarification of the pathways \nwhich lead to different forms of mental \nill health.  \nHowever, the risk factors which are \nassociated with poor mental health may \nbe poorly understood; within the \nframework of this review, itself limited, \nonly twelve risk factors at all levels were \nidentified which were connected with \npoor mental health. A holistic, connected \napproach to identifying risk factors and \nindividuals and communities at risk may \nfacilitate a more appropriate \nconceptualisation of the mental health \nagenda and its resource implications. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n9    Discussion of cross-cutting themes \n55 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \n9.2 Risk Factors and Associations \nBy comparing the known risk factors for \neach outcome, with the populations or \nrisk factors targeted by the included \nreviews, it was possible to draw a grid of \nassociations (see Table 1 below).  This \nallows patterns of research to be \nexamined and gaps and trends to be \nidentified. \n9.2.1 Gaps and trends in research \nA common theme across all risk levels and \noutcomes is that rarely, if ever, were all \nknown risk factors addressed by the \nincluded reviews. For example, one out \nof four known individual risk factors for \nmental health was addressed by the \ninterventions we identified. All the \nprotective identified in this study were \naddressed by research contained in the \nreviews.  \nOutcomes which fared particularly badly \nin terms of having risk factors addressed \nOR identified were: drug and alcohol \nmisuse, NEET, and low attainment.  \n9.2.2 Individual/Peer risk factors \nJust under half of the individual and peer \nrisk factors were targeted by \ninterventions and by systematic reviews \nwhich aimed to change individual \nbehaviour or attitudes through personal \nskills training, cognitive interventions, or \nfamily management interventions. This \npossibly reflects current research and \npolicy priorities, as well as prevailing \nsocio-political ideological and moral \ndiscourses. Of the 27 associations \nbetween the risk factors and outcomes, \n12 were addressed by interventions. Risk \nfactors not addressed, or addressed rarely \nincluded age, gender, ethnicity, early \ninvolvement in problem behaviour, \nalienation and lack of social commitment. \nThis may reflect a lack of targeting (e.g. \nat single-sex, single-age group \npopulations), a lack of reporting of \nTable 1: the number of risk factors per outcome targeted by reviews in each outcome \narea (number targeted/number known risk factors) \n Individual Family School Community Protective Total \nnumber of \nassociations \nYouth Offending 6/8 5/6 2/5 1/4 5/5 19/28 \nDrug/Alcohol 3/6 4/6 0/3 0/1 3/3 9/19 \nTeen \npregnancy/sexual \nhealth \n0/1 2/4 0/1 1/2 0/0 3/8 \nPoor outcomes for \nteens  \n1/1 1/2 0/0 0/0 2/2 4/5 \nNEET 1/3 0/4 1/3 0/2 0/0 2/12 \nLow attainment 0/3 0/3 3/3 0/0 0/0 3/9 \nYouth \nhomelessness \n0/1 4/5 0/0 0/0 0/0 4/6 \nMental health 1/4 3/4 1/3 1/1 0/0 6/12 \nTotal number of \nassociations \n12/27 18/34 7/18 3/11 10/10 \n9    Discussion of cross-cutting themes \n56 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \ndetails of individual interventions within \nreviews, or the immutable nature of \nthese risk factors.  \nThis concentration of research on the \nidentification of individual/peer level risk \nfactors and on evaluations of \ninterventions which operate at this level, \nmay reflect the greater influence of these \nfactors in determining outcomes. \nHowever, we risk an oversimplification of \nthe pathways and choices people make \nwhich lead them to poor outcomes. The \nreasons, however complex, that lead \nvulnerable young people to unintended \nteenage parenthood are multi-faceted \nand may well be different qualitatively \nand quantitatively from the reasons which \nare identified as leading to drug misuse. \nTo attempt to alleviate these different \noutcomes through similar interventions \nmay be ineffective and inappropriate.  \nDespite this concentration of \ninterventions at this level, low \nattainment, NEET, mental health and \nrunning away were all identified as having \nindividual/peer level risk factors which \nwere not addressed by included studies. \nThese represent gaps in the research \nevidence.  \n9.2.3 Family risk factors \nFamily-level factors were addressed with \nsimilar frequency, with 18 out of 34 \nassociations between risk factors and \noutcomes being addressed by \ninterventions. This may reflect the \nrelative ease of carrying out interventions \nwhich target families, rather than \ncommunities, or may reflect cost, \nlogistic, ideological or political concerns. \nInterventions which operated at this level \ntended to be family management or \nparenting programmes, which aimed to \nalter behaviour or attitudes. Foster care \nand independent living programmes were \nalso used to target risk factors at this \nlevel. They frequently addressed risk \nfactors such as family history of problem \nbehaviour, parental involvement or \ncondoning attitudes, and parental \nsupervision.  \nRisk factors at this level which were not \naddressed, or were rarely addressed, \nincluded low income and poor housing, \nfamily conflict, caring responsibilities, \nand experience of authority care. Low \nincome and poor housing was not a \ntargeted outcome for any reviews, \npossibly reflecting the increased difficulty \nof implementing interventions in this \narea. „Experience of authority care‟ \nsimilarly was under-researched, and the \nonly study which referred to this risk \nfactor was mapped against youth \noffending because it targeted young \npeople who had been in care.  \nLow attainment, NEET and teen \npregnancy were identified as having \nmultiple risk factors at the family level \nwhich were not addressed by \ninterventions. This constitutes another \nresearch gap.  \n9.2.4 School risk factors \nOf the eighteen school level risk factor/ \noutcome associations identified, only \nseven were addressed by interventions, \ndemonstrating a paucity of research on \nthese relationships. Significant numbers \nof research studies seem to have been \nconducted in school settings, but without \nspecifically targeting school risk factors. \nThis may suggest that an outcome which \nhas a health focus (such as teen \npregnancy) may be affected by risk \nfactors traditionally addressed by \neducation professionals and/or \nacademics. This could be seen to justify \nthe current policy to promote \nconnectedness in youth services, \nespecially for vulnerable young people. \nFurther research in this area would clarify \nthe nature of the relationship between \nthe risk factor and the outcome, in \naddition to providing a range of effective \nstrategies which could be employed by \nschools to improve youth offending and \nanti-social behaviour. \n9    Discussion of cross-cutting themes \n57 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \nInterventions addressing school level risk \nfactors tended to focus on person-centred \nteaching, or cognitive behavioural \ntherapies. School level risk factors, which \nwere not addressed, or were rarely \naddressed, included a lack of \ncommitment including truancy, school \nexclusions, school disorganisation, and \nlow achievement. Interestingly, none of \nthe interventions considered to be \naffecting school-level risk factors were \neducational or set in schools. This may \nreflect a dislocation between youth \nservices, or between youth services and \nthe academic community. Greater \ncommunication and connectedness \nbetween these institutions would improve \ninformation transfer and facilitate \neffective assistance of vulnerable young \npeople. \n9.2.5 Community risk factors \nFew interventions were seen which \noperated at the community level. Only \nthree out of eleven associations between \nrisk factors and outcomes at the \ncommunity level were addressed by \ninterventions in the reviews identified. \nNo interventions addressed the \navailability of drugs, high turnover or lack \nof neighbourhood attachment. \nDisadvantaged neighbourhoods were \nconsidered in only one intervention. \nInterventions at this level comprised \ninitiatives such as family outreach \nprogrammes and youth development \nprogrammes. The distinction between \ncommunity-level outcomes and \ninterventions which operate at a \ncommunity level is only crudely drawn in \nthis report; further research could \nexplore this in depth. \nMost community risk factors were not \naddressed by the studies, identifying \nanother gap in the evidence base. Again, \nthis may reflect the difficulty of targeting \nthese risk factors given their diverse \nnature, e.g. operating at several levels at \nonce. Nevertheless, this provides \njustification for evaluations of \ncommunity-level policy initiatives \ntargeting these factors, given their known \nassociation to poor outcomes. Research in \nthis area would be welcomed. Included \nreviews targeted risk factors such as a \nlack of community resources (e.g. leisure \ncentres). This lack of research means we \ndo not understand the effect of \ncommunity-level risk factors, nor what \nthey may be or how they interact with \nother risk factors, or the effectiveness \nand appropriateness of interventions \nwhich operate at this level, and that the \npotential for alleviating poor outcomes is \nnot gauged. \n9.2.6 Protective Factors  \nSeveral systematic reviews also included \ninterventions which attempted to foster \nprotective factors, as well as, or instead \nof, alleviating the risk factors. Although \ngeneralisations should be read with \ncaution, these reviews seemed to show \nan overall beneficial effect. These factors \nalso operate at several levels (individual, \nschool and family, for example) and may \ninfluence vulnerable young people in \nseveral arenas. \n9.3 Discussion and patterns of \nresearch \nThese results should be interpreted with \ncaution, for several reasons. Primarily, it \nis not known if risk factors have a \ncausative relationship with the outcomes, \nand therefore it is essential not to \noverstate the case. \nSeveral gaps have been identified in the \nresearch through this exercise. However, \npart of the searching was non-systematic \n(e.g. the risk factor search was \ncumulative rather than systematic), and \nresearch may have been missed. Gaps \nmay also reflect the search strategy and \ninclusion criteria, or the division of the \nrisk factors into levels. More risk factors \nfor some outcomes were addressed than \nfor others; for example, almost no risk \nfactors were addressed for NEET, and a \nfar greater proportion for youth \noffending. This may simply reflect that \n9    Discussion of cross-cutting themes \n58 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \nmore research has been carried out in \nthat area, so saturation of risk factors is \nmore likely. \nWithout further research, we cannot \nknow the relative importance of different \nrisk factors for the outcome, or of the \nimportance of the levels. Are individual \nor peer risk factors more influential than \ncommunity risk factors when individuals \nmake choices about their behaviour? It is \nalso difficult to unpick the relationship \nbetween the risk factors; they may \ninteract in ways that we do not \nunderstand.  \nFinally, since structural/environmental \nfactors did not feature prominently in our \nreview of risk factors, they are not part \nof the conceptual framework for the \nreview of reviews. They may have as big \nan effect on people‟s behaviour: for \nexample, legislative impact, such as \nemployment protection for mothers; \nfinancial factors such as benefits \nprovision; or environmental, such as \nprovision of local, accessible leisure \nfacilities. Further research is required to \nelucidate this relationship and ascertain \nwhether their lack of prominence is an \nartefact of the questions asked in the risk \nfactor studies, or whether \nstructural/environmental issues are not \nsignificant risk factors for the TYS \noutcomes. \n9.4 Implications  \nInteresting gaps were identified through \nthis exercise. For example, a great deal \nof research is carried out in school \nsettings but without specifically targeting \nschool risk factors. This may suggest that \nan outcome which has a health focus may \nbe affected by risk factors traditionally \naddressed by the education professionals \nand/or academics. This could be seen to \njustify the current policy to promote \nconnectedness in youth services, \nespecially for vulnerable young people. \nTheories of behaviour differ in the degree \nof importance they attach to different \nrisk factors. For example, some people \nconsider that personal choice and history \nto be the greatest determinants of \nindividual behaviour, while others believe \nthat the structural and local \nenvironments are more influential. These \nfactors undoubtedly interact in a complex \nand unique way for different people, \nadding to the challenge faced by social \nscientists in addressing behavioural \noutcomes. Currently, more risk factors \nhave been identified (and more are \naddressed) at the individual and family \nlevels. This may reflect the greater \nimportance of these levels in determining \nbehaviour. Equally, this may reflect the \ngreater emphasis placed on individualism \nand personal responsibility by \npolicymakers and scientists alike. \nResearch to explore the implications of \ncommunity and environmental level \nfactors would be welcomed, as would \ninterventions targeting the risk factors \nwhich operate at this level.  \nThis research also underlines the \nimportance of considering known risk \nfactors before designing interventions. It \nseems likely that by targeting known risk \nfactors (assuming the „correct‟ ones have \nbeen identified), greater efficacy could \nbe achieved. Clearly not all risk factors \ncan be alleviated (for example, being \nmale), and interventions may be found to \nbe more effective if they are targeted at \nthese at-risk populations.  \nThe majority of the interventions \nreported by the systematic reviews aimed \nto reduce the incidence of an outcome. \nWhile most interventions addressed one \nor more risk factors, none used a \ncombined approach targeting all known \nrisk factors in a multi-faceted \nintervention. Another interesting \napproach, which has not been identified \nwithin the systematic reviews in this \nreport, is targeting a specific risk factor, \nsuch as social alienation, through a range \nof interventions and providers, and \nexamining the outcomes known to be \nassociated with it; in this case, poor \n9    Discussion of cross-cutting themes \n59 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \nmental health, NEET, and youth crime. \nThis approach might require a different \ntype of intervention, and require more \nresearch on the relationship between \ndifferent risk factors and their associated \noutcomes, their strength of association \nand the interactions between them. It \nmay prove a fruitful approach. A \nsystematic review examining multi-\nprovider interventions would make the \nutility of such an approach explicit and \ncould provide guidance to policymakers. \n \n \n10    Discussion \n60 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \n10  Discussion \n \n10.1 Interventions can have \nunintended consequences \nEven though policymakers and \npractitioners aim to improve the lives of \nthe recipients of their interventions, \nsometimes interventions can have \nsurprising results. In a non-exhaustive \nexamination of the 57 reviews in this \nstudy, four reviews report interventions \nthat had harmful effects (as well as two \nothers which were identified but not \nincluded in the final report). \nOakley et al (1995) describe an \nabstinence education intervention \ntargeted at a group of low income \nminority group youths in Arizona, USA. \nThe programme had high rates of \nattrition and appears to have increased \nthe number of young men claiming to \nhave initiated intercourse by the time it \nwas completed – so had the opposite \neffect to the one intended. DiCenso et al \n(2002) also report a harmful sexual health \nintervention. This time the outcome was \npregnancy – and they found that the \nintervention was responsible for an \nincrease, rather than a decrease, in \nreported pregnancies. \nSimilarly, the intervention termed \n„Scared Straight‟ (Petrosino et al 2003) \nalso had the opposite effect to that \nintended. This intervention aims to \n„scare‟ young people away from criminal \nbehaviour by exposing them to the harsh \nrealities of prison life. When evaluated, \nhowever, the intervention was shown to \nincrease crime. Finally, the review by \nGodley and Velasquez (1998) contained \nan intervention that was found to have \nincreased participants‟ use of marijuana. \nSome take the view that ineffective \ninterventions are also harmful, since \nresources are committed to them that \nmight be better used elsewhere. Using \nthis definition of harmful, a great many \ninterventions found in this REA would be \nconsidered to be harmful. \nAs well as having the opposite effect to \nthose intended, interventions can have \nknock-on effects on the use of services. \nFor example, Elliott (2002) found that \nwhen counselling and residential care was \noffered to parents and young people in \nrespect of drug use, their use of medical \nservices increased. Clearly, a greater \nuptake of service use can have \nimplications for their resources – \nsomething that needs to be anticipated \nwhen a given intervention is considered. \nOne of the reviews – DiCenso et al (2002) \n– provides a cautionary note in terms of \nits outcomes. While the interventions, \noverall, did not appear to have any \nimpact on reducing teenage pregnancy \nrates, some suggested that intervening \namong young men might actually lead to \nincreases in the number of pregnancies. \nThis is a reminder to consider that \ninterventions can have different effects \non different sub-groups (e.g. males versus \nfemales), and that a generally targeted \nintervention – such as sex education in \nschools – might well produce different \neffects among different people. \n10.2 Multi-provider interventions \nOur analysis of multi-component \ninterventions (described in Chapter 8) did \nnot reveal any definite patterns. While \nthis may be partly due to the reporting \nissues discussed in Chapter 8, other \nfactors contributing to this is the \nheterogeneity of outcomes and \npopulations, study designs and \ncomponents. A systematic review of \nmulti-component or multi-provider \ninterventions may prove more useful in \n10    Discussion \n61 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \nexploring patterns of delivery, target \npopulations, effectiveness and outcomes. \nA sustained and systematic examination \nof the theoretical and logistic barriers to \nimplementing multi-component \ninterventions and their impact could be \nused to inform policy in a range of areas \nand promote cross-sector working. \nHowever, the majority of the multi-\ncomponent interventions appear to show \nbeneficial effects.  \nWhile this does not provide a concrete \njustification for greater communication \nbetween youth services, it does not \nappear that this would be harmful. \nMoreover, a high-quality map or review \nwould assist in developing evidence-based \npolicy and practice recommendations for \nTYS. \n10.3 Strengths and limitations of \nthis work \n10.3.1 The rapid review of reviews \n(Component 2)  \nOne notable feature of this REA, \ncompared with other REAs (and some \nsystematic reviews) is the quantity and \nrobustness of the evidence it contains. It \nis a wide-ranging review of the literature, \ncovering many topic areas and, because \nits conclusions are based on systematic \nreviews, the evidence behind its findings \ncan, on the whole, be considered to be \nhigh quality and robust. However, this \nwas a rapid review of reviews, and \ntherefore has some weaknesses due to \nthis design which are detailed below. \nOne cautionary methodological note to \nsound concerns the difficulty of drawing \nconclusions on multi-component \ninterventions based on a review of \nreviews. By their very nature, systematic \nreviews aim to answer specific questions – \ne.g. the effectiveness of interventions to \nreduce substance misuse. However, while \nmany interventions aim to impact on \nmultiple outcomes, systematic reviews \nhave to be careful to only report on those \noutcomes for which they have searched. \nIf they did not, bias could easily creep in. \nThus, most reviews in this report only \nappear in one section – e.g. youth \noffending – even though some the \ninterventions they contain may well have \nreported outcomes relevant to other \nareas (e.g. sexual health, substance \nmisuse etc). This means that it has been \ndifficult for this review to draw \nconclusions regarding multi-component \ninterventions that are able to improve a \nnumber of outcomes simultaneously \nbecause: a) most systematic reviews \nreport single outcomes (or outcomes in \none domain); and b) because very few \ncross-cutting systematic reviews appear \nto have been commissioned. \nIn addition, and more generally, many of \nthe included reviews overlapped \nchronologically, or in terms of scope, or \nincluded papers. Some studies were \ntherefore included in several reviews \nand/or meta-analyses, and for the \nreview-of-reviews undertaken here were \ntherefore counted several times. \nAlthough this is likely to have had a very \nlimited effect, if any bias at all, it is \nimportant to be aware that this is a \npotentially problematic methodological \nfeature of reviews of reviews. \nThe quality of the included reviews was \nin general, high. Ample information was \noffered on the process and methods, and \non the characteristics of the included \nstudies. Another common feature was the \nlimited information given on the content \n(i.e., what actually happened to the \nparticipants) of the interventions \nincluded in each of the systematic \nreviews. This offers particular challenges \nto a review-of-reviews synthesis, as was \nattempted in this case.  \nIn the clinical and medical science \nliterature, interventions tend to be  \nsingle-component and are compared to \nother single component comparisons, e.g. \nDrug A vs Drug B, or surgery type A vs \nnone. Meta-syntheses of these are \n10    Discussion \n62 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \ntherefore simpler to undertake, and \nimplications easier to reach, given ease \nwith which these interventions can be \ndefined. In the social sciences, \ninterventions may be delivered by several \ndiscrete providers, the content may vary \nin style, modality, setting, theory; even if \nall interventions included in a review \naimed to effect the same outcome (for \nexample, the number of teen \npregnancies) so many variables are \nemployed that carrying out a synthesis is \na challenge. This challenge is increased \nwhen, as was found when attempting to \nidentify the multi-component \ninterventions, little information about \nintervention contents is reported in \nsystematic reviews (possibly reflecting a \nsimilar trend in primary studies). \nThis finding emphasises the need for \nauthors of primary studies to report \nsufficiently detailed information about \nthe intervention itself, in order that \nreplication is possible (and for reviewers \nsubsequently to include detailed \ndescriptions), and to allow cost \neffectiveness analyses to be undertaken. \nMore information about interventions \nwould also allow more meaningful \nsyntheses to be completed, and stronger \nconclusions about the characteristics of a \nsuccessful intervention to be drawn. \nFinally, while being a systematic \nexamination of the evidence base in this \narea, this Rapid Evidence Assessment is \nnot a full systematic review and differs \nsignificantly from a full systematic review \nin the scope and depth of its searches.  \nSearching for a full systematic review can \noften take more than three months, while \nthe searches for this report took \napproximately one month.  The searches \nwe conducted depended almost \nexclusively on electronic databases and \nwere not accompanied by the usual \npractice of searching key journals by \nhand.  We also utilised more specific \nsearch terms than usual. Even so, we \nscreened many thousands of references \nand the fact that we found few reviews \nthat we‟d missed (when examining \nincluded systematic reviews for other \nrelevant reviews), suggests that we have \nlocated most relevant evidence. \n10.3.2 The description of risk and \nprotective factors (Component \n1) \nWe have a considerable number of studies \nincluded in Component 1. However, the \nevidence in this Component is not the \nresult of a full systematic search, and \ntherefore should not be taken as being \nexhaustive. Gaps do not necessarily \nhighlight a lack of research; they may \nindicate simply that a relevant study was \nnot included or that the relevant question \nwas not asked. \nIt is also important to reiterate the point \nmade in Section 7.1 above: that whilst \nevidence may exist of a correlation \nbetween a risk or protective factor and a \nparticular outcome, this does not \nnecessarily mean that there is a causal \nlink between the two, particularly when \nthere is no other evidence to support a \nlink.  \n11    Recommendations and implications \n63 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \n11 Recommendations and \nimplications \n \nThe following recommendations were \nthose identified by our expert panel \nduring a day of discussion about the \nfindings presented in Section 6 of this \nreport. \n11.1 Research Recommendations \nThese refer to specific questions \ndeveloped using expert opinion and the \nevidence base. \n11.1.1 General \n What increases social engagement \nof vulnerable young people? \n What is the relationship between, \nand relative importance of, \ndifferent risk factors? \n How do we measure the \nrelationship between risk and \noutcome?

Interventions interpreted \nas „not working‟ may just be less \neffective for certain groups \n There is a need for more joint \nplanning and collaboration \nbetween various agencies working \nin each area  \n Government needs to recognize \nthat engaging with „hard to reach \ngroups‟ takes time. This needs to \nbe reflected in programme \nfunding, monitoring and \nperformance measures  \n We emphasise the importance of \njoint commissioning focused on \nspecific defined outcomes \n Improved  transparency of the \nprocess of moving from evidence \nto recommendations would be \nwelcomed \n11.3.2 Workforce \n Local agents need to be flexible, \nnot protective over their area/ \nagencies, and need to consider \nwho is best placed to deliver a \ngiven service \n A skilled workforce for \ninterventions and referral might \nhave a bigger impact, and would \nalso clarify who delivers what \n Training for teachers should be \nevaluated  \n Sustainable workforce \ndevelopment is essential \n11.3.3 Service delivery \n How can we personalize service \nfrom a menu of different options \navailable to the practitioner? \n We recognise the need to be \naware of the whole process \nbefore even the delivery of the \nintervention.  \n Authorities need to identify need \nin the local area and be clear \nabout desired outcomes \n More communication of risk \nconcerns is required amongst \ndifference agencies, to trigger \ntimely targeted response. For \nexample, schools need to \nrecognise bad behaviour as a risk \nfactor with wider implications \nthan immediately apparent, and \nbe in communication with  other \nagencies about those at risk \n Improved school buy-in is \nrequired. They could be \ncommissioning agents themselves \n11.3.4 Working with young people \nThe following were all considered \nimportant for people working with \nvulnerable young people: \n Promoting of sense of belonging \nin schools \n Highlighting the importance of \nearly identification of young \npeople at risk  \n Empowerment of young people \n11    Recommendations and implications \n66 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \n Person-centred relationships are \nkey; broader educational policy \nwould address this  \n Relationships between underlying \nfactors need to be considered for \nindividuals \n Extensive long term engagement \nstrategy and relationship building \nwould improve services \n Different services may have \nconflicting priorities; for \nexample, addressing parenting \nskills doesn‟t necessarily address \nNEET and schooling \n Structural issues play a role \n12    Potential conflicts of interest \n67 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \n12 Potential conflicts of interest \nThere were no conflicts of interest. \n \n \n \n \n  \n 68 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPart II: Technical description of the rapid evidence \nassessment \n13    Methods for Component 1 (identification of risk factors) \n69 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \n13 Methods for Component 1 (identification of risk factors) \n \n13.1 Identifying and describing \nstudies \nSince the aim of this Component was to \nprovide a conceptual framework for \nComponent 2, and not be a systematic \nreview in its own right, studies were \nidentified through a series of targeted \nweb searches of key organisations. These \nincluded: Ministry of Justice, Home \nOffice, Teenage Pregnancy Unit, DCSF, \nDfES, Every Child Matters, Department of \nHealth, Connexions, Cabinet Office \n(Social Exclusion Unit), Basic Skills \nAgency, DWP, Drug Education Forum, \nCentrepoint, Scottish Executive, Welsh \nAssembly, ESRC, Office for National \nStatistics, Centre for Longitudinal Studies \n(CLS), the UK Data Archive and other \nuniversity websites. This was not \nintended to be a systematic indexing of \nthe risk factors known to affect the types \nof outcomes identified as being of \ninterest. However, using a semi-iterative \nmethod, relevant longitudinal studies and \nassociated evaluations were identified \nthrough the publications lists of the \nwebsites above (the CLS website in \nparticular), and papers associated with \ndatasets of interest.  \nSurveys and longitudinal studies of young \npeople in the UK were located and \nincluded if they describe risk or \nprotective factors associated with the \nTYS outcomes. Included studies were \nentered into a spreadsheet and a \nnarrative detailing the relationship \nbetween the risk factor and outcome \nwritten. The list of outcomes is static \n(defined in the TYS guide), but the list of \nfactors grew as more studies were added \nto the matrix. It is important to stress \nthat although these included studies \ndescribed a relationship between risk \nfactors and the outcomes of interest, it is \nnot appropriate for this review to posit \ncausality or suggest different strengths of \nassociation in this report. The aim was to \nidentify a conceptual framework, not to \nprovide an exhaustive map of the \nrelationships between risk factors and \noutcomes, and caution must be employed \nin utilising the findings presented here. \nHowever, some studies did discuss \nstrength of association (e.g. CTC/youth \njustice discussed a change in odds ratio) \nwhich is welcome, and reporting this \ninformation is to be encouraged. \nSimilarly, strength of effect (likelihood of \ndeveloping an outcome based on one, or \na combination of risk factors) must be \nviewed with caution, since there may \nalways be unknown risk factors not \nidentified as part of the analysis, or \nthresholds of risk, which nevertheless \ncontribute to the development of the \noutcome in question.\n14    Methods for Component 2 (the rapid review of reviews, or REA) \n70 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \n14 Methods for Component 2 (the rapid review of reviews, or \nREA) \n \nThe EPPI-Centre tools and guidelines for \nundertaking systematic reviews were used \nthroughout the conduct of the REA, in \norder to limit bias at all stages (EPPI-\nCentre 2007). All data were entered into \nEPPI-Reviewer: the EPPI-Centre‟s bespoke \nsoftware for conducting systematic \nreviews (Thomas and Brunton 2007). As \nwell as streamlining the review process, \nthis software aids sustainability and \nmeans that we will have a descriptive \ndatabase of all the reviews that can be \nutilised in the future. \nThe rapid evidence assessment is a \nlimited search review using the review of \nreviews approach.  In this approach:   \nwhere a comprehensive set of search \nterms would result in thousands \nof references to screen (an \nunmanageable amount in the \ntime available), the search was \nrestricted in scope and uses only \nkey terms rather than extensive \nsearch of all variants;  \na simple descriptive map of included \nstudies is produced to aid \ndecisions on finalizing scope for \nthe in-depth aspect of REA; the \nmap was used to focus a \ndiscussion with the DCSF in \nFebruary 2008; \nelectronically available abstracts and \ntexts were prioritised and no \n„hand searching‟ was conducted. \nThe first stage of the REA produced a \ndescriptive „map‟ of research evidence \nthat contained a description of the type \nof intervention, the subjects and the \ncontexts. The map was used to help make \ndecisions about where to focus efforts in \nthe second stage of the REA. \n14.1 User involvement \nConsultations between the DCSF policy \nteam and the research team at the EPPI-\nCentre throughout the REA ensured that \nthe review addresses the most important \nissues. As well as consultation via the \nprotocol, a key consultation point for this \nComponent was the discussion of the \nfinalised mapping of reviews in February \n2008. The scope of the map was set quite \nbroadly to encompass the dual focus of \noutcome interventions and risk/ \nprotective factors. Once the results of \nthe map had been discussed with the \npolicy team the nature and focus of the \nin-depth stage of the REA was agreed. \n14.2 Identifying and describing \nstudies \n14.2.1 Defining relevant studies: \ninclusion and exclusion criteria \nAn explicit search strategy was developed \nand applied systematically to relevant \ndatabases and search engines. For a \nsystematic review to be included in the \nmap, it had to meet the following \ncriteria: \nInclusion criteria: \n The review had to have been \npublished in 1995 or after. (It was \ndecided not to go back further \nthan this because of time \nlimitations and the need to \nensure that the interventions had \nrelevance to current policy.) \n The review had to state that it \nwas a systematic review or meta-\nanalysis in its title or abstract). \n14    Methods for Component 2 (the rapid review of reviews, or REA) \n71 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \n The study population had to be \nyoung people (defined in Section \n5) \n The review had to focus on \nstudies that seek to prevent the \nTYS outcomes listed in Section 5. \n  \nThe search was also restricted to reviews \nwritten in English, as members of the \nteam did not have access or ability to \nsearch databases in additional languages \nand did not have the resources to screen \nand translate documents into English.  \n14.2.2 Identification of potential \nstudies: search strategy \nThe exclusion and inclusion criteria were \napplied to the papers identified using the \nsearch strategy. \nGeneral strategy \nThe search was as exhaustive as possible, \nbut could not be as extensive as would be \ncarried out in a full systematic review. \nChiefly, the search was limited by: \n- not „hand searching‟ journals \n- not emailing all authors of \nincluded reviews to ask for \nfurther relevant references \n- restricting search terms to key \nterms only in cases in which \nunmanageable numbers of \nreferences are retrieved by a \ncomprehensive set of terms  \n- having an early cut-off date for \ndocument retrieval – meaning \nthat documents that could be \nsourced electronically were \nprioritized \nThere are three components to our REA \nquestion: the type of research we looked \nfor (systematic reviews), the population \n(young people) and the outcomes (see \nSection 5). Breaking the question down \ninto these components made it possible \nto operationalise a search strategy that \nwas both sensitive and acceptably \nspecific. Each part of the search has a set \nof terms associated with it, linked by OR \n(e.g. “YOUNG PEOPLE” OR “YOUTH” OR \n“TEENAGERS” OR “ADOLESCENTS” etc). \nThis ensured we captured all the relevant \nliterature in that area. Guidelines \ndeveloped by the Scottish Intercollegiate \nGuidelines Network were used to help \nidentify systematic reviews1. \nEach component was then brought \ntogether with AND in order to identify the \nset of literature that meets each one of \nthe requirements of our REA. This \nstrategy is captured graphically in Figure \n1.  \nA search string was developed for each of \nthe three components and separately for \neach of the outcomes. For the purposes \nof this review a list of key words was \ndeveloped to capture reviews with a \nfocus on one or more of the outcomes. \nInitial pilot searches were run and a \nsample screening of abstracts revealed \nwhether further filtering of key words \nwas necessary. The preliminary screen \nwas also used to „pearl grow‟ additional \nsearch terms.  \nAfter establishing a base group of reviews \nbelonging to group 1 and 2 (see Figure 1), \neach outcome filter was applied to the \nbase group, followed by a combined \nsearch using the Boolean operator OR to \neliminate duplication and at the same \ntime ensure inclusion of studies \naddressing multiple outcomes. \n \n                                                          \n1\n \nhttp://www.sign.ac.uk/methodology/filters.ht\nml \n14    Methods for Component 2 (the rapid review of reviews, or REA) \n72 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \nThe outcome „Under 18 conceptions and \npoor sexual health‟ was separated into \ntwo subgroups („under 18 conceptions) \nand („poor sexual health‟), as it was \nsuspected that a number of important \nstudies might deal with the former or \nlatter outcome aspect, though not \nnecessarily both. A limited key terms \nsearch was applied to „poor sexual \nhealth‟ with a reduced search string of \n(sex* behaviour OR sex* health OR sex* \nrelation* OR sex* active OR sex* \neducation) after a more extensive search \nstring (including synonyms of „poor‟ and \nother negative outcome terminology, as \nwell as key terms to capture sexually \nrelated illnesses and diseases) resulted in \nunmanageable numbers of irrelevant hits \nfrom Medline and Pubmed. \nThe outcome category „Poor outcomes for \nteenage parents and their children‟ \nproved to be difficult to operationalise, \nas key search terms required assumptions \nabout what might constitute such poor \noutcomes. Further, differentiating \nbetween poor outcomes for the teenage \nparents in contrast to poor outcomes for \nthe children of teenage parents would \nhave severely limited the effectiveness of \nthe searches. A decision was therefore \nmade to execute a broadened search \nencompassing systematic reviews on \nteenage parenthood (and pregnancies) \nand children of teenage/young parents, \nwith an aim to identify sub groups of poor \noutcomes in the screening process.  \nThe search string on „16-18 year-olds not \nin education, employment and training \n(NEET)‟ posed different issues as the \nterminology of „NEET‟ and the \nsurrounding keyword phrases (e.g. „not in \nEmployment, Education or Training‟ are \nof relatively recent origin (DfES 2000) and \nnot necessarily reflected in the research \nliterature around and before this time). A \nproximity search allowed for a broader \ninitial search focus, which was narrowed \nin later searches. The set of search terms \nfor each component of the search are \nrecorded in Appendix A. \nSearch strings: These were tailored to the \nindividual databases in order to \naccommodate the variations in Boolean \n1.

The \nfollowing data bases were included:  \nASSIA: Applied Social Sciences Index and \nAbstracts, BHI: British Humanities Index, \nCinahl, The Cochrane Library, Criminal \nJustice Abstracts, Embase, The EPPI-\nCentre knowledge library, ERIC, IBSS, \nMEDline, National Criminal Justice \nReference Service Abstracts, PAIS \nInternational, Physical Education Index, \nPsychinfo, Sociological Abstracts, Social \nServices Abstracts. \nA hand search of the Campbell \ncollaboration yielded an additional 2 \nstudies which had not been captured \nthough the Cochrane Collection.  \nIn addition, a search of Google Scholar \nand key academic websites was \nconducted in order to pick up reports that \nare not indexed on the large databases \nand other grey literature. Search strings \nwere simplified to accommodate the \nGoogle search functions which could not \nreplicate the complex search pattern \nestablished for this review. Basic internet \nsearch queries resulted in excessively \nhigh numbers of hits but upon \nexamination did not add any new studies \nto the review.   \nIn addition to the electronic searches \ndetailed here, the reference lists of \nincluded reviews were scanned for other \npotentially relevant systematic reviews. \n14.2.3 Screening studies: applying \ninclusion and exclusion criteria \nTitle and abstracts of identified studies \nwere imported and entered into EPPI-\nReviewer - which has online reference \nscreening functionality that can be used \nin place of external reference software. \nInclusion and exclusion criteria were \napplied successively to titles and \nabstracts. \nStudies that clearly did not meet the \ncriteria for the review were excluded at \nthis stage. Full reports were obtained for \nall the remaining studies that appeared to \nmeet the criteria or where we had \ninsufficient information to clearly exclude \nthem. The inclusion and exclusion criteria \nwere then re-applied to the full reports, \nand those which did not meet the full \ncriteria were excluded.  \nBibliographies of relevant reviews were \nscanned for other potentially relevant \nsystematic reviews to provide a quality \ncontrol mechanism. The low return rate \nof the citation search reflected the highly \nsensitive level of the trilateral search \nstrategy. \n14.2.4 Characterising included studies  \nThe studies remaining after application of \nthe criteria were data extracted using a \nset of questions developed specifically for \nthis Rapid Evidence Assessment. All data \nextraction was carried out on EPPI-\nReviewer. There were two levels of \ncoding for data extraction. The first level \nfor all studies included in the map \nprovided data for the purposes of \ndescribing or mapping the overall field of \nresearch on the topic area. This map \nformed the basis of our discussion with \nthe DCSF outlined in Section 14.1. The \nsecond level of coding provided detailed \ninformation about studies included in the \nin-depth REA necessary for the purpose of \ndescription, quality assessment and \nsynthesis and the identification of \nrelevant reviews from the map. \nData were extracted by a first reviewer \nand confirmed by a second reviewer. \nData extraction tables were used to \npresent information about the systematic \nreviews included in the REA.  Reviews are \npresented according to setting and data \n14    Methods for Component 2 (the rapid review of reviews, or REA) \n74 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \nwere extracted concentrating on the \nfollowing issues: \nArea of extraction (Details) \nGeneral study characteristics (e.g. year, \ncountry of publication) \nMethodological characteristics  (e.g. \nsearch strategy, quality assessment) \nParticipant characteristics  (e.g. age, \nethnicity) \nOutcome characteristics (e.g. which \noutcomes targeted) \nInterventions (e.g. description of \ninterventions) \nType of intervention (e.g. strategy and \napproach) \nSetting of intervention (e.g. secure \nestablishment, classroom) \nOutcome measures (e.g. how \neffectiveness was measured) \n14.2.5 Identifying and describing \nstudies: quality assurance \nprocesses \nThe REA followed standard EPPI-Centre \nprocedures for maintaining quality. At the \nscreening stage an initial sample of titles \nand abstracts/ studies was screened \nindependently by all the team members. \nThe results were shared and discussed to \nensure consistency of application of the \ninclusion criteria. The decision for \ninclusion and exclusion was then made by \none assessor who referred to another \nwhenever they were unsure about the \nrelevance of a given study. If there was \nany doubt, the decision for identifying \nand describing studies was made by the \nEPPI-Centre senior researcher. Any \ndifferences were resolved through \ndiscussion and recorded. All extraction of \ndata, whether for the map or synthesis, \nwas conducted by two researchers \nworking independently and then meeting \nto resolve any differences. \n14.3 Assessment of quality and \nrelevance \nReviews were assessed for methodological \nquality and relevance to this REA using \nthe EPPI-Centre‟s assessment tools: The \nEPPI centre Weight of Evidence \nframework. \nWOE A the soundness of reviews (internal \nmethodological coherence), based upon \nthe review only; \nWOE B the appropriateness of the \nresearch design and analysis used for \nanswering the REA question; and  \nWOE C the relevance of the review topic \nfocus (from the sample, measures, \nscenario, or other indicator of the focus \nof the study) to the REA question (i.e. an \nassessment of generalisability). \nWOE D  An overall weight taking into \naccount A, B, C \nWOE A was judged according to whether \nor not the review is a good systematic \nreview. In particular, we checked: their \nsearch strategies, methods of data \nextraction, quality assessment (in order \nfor selection bias in the primary studies \nthey contain not to be biasing their \nresults), and synthesis. An existing tool \nused at the EPPI-Centre, for the quality \nassessment of health promotion reviews, \nwas adapted and used to judge WOE A for \neach included systematic review. \nWOE B is important in reviews that \ncontain different types of research. Since \nwe are focusing on systematic reviews, \nthis aspect of quality and relevance is \nbeing taken care of in the inclusion \ncriteria for the REA. We expect all \nincluded reviews to score highly on this \ncriterion. \nIt was also important to consider the \nrelevance of sample, measures and other \ncontextual factors (WOE C) to the Rapid \nEvidence Assessment.  A review of \nprimary studies undertaken in, for \nexample, Finland may be viewed as less \nrelevant than one of primary studies \nconducted in the UK. \nThe results of assessing the reviews for \nquality and relevance fed through into \n14    Methods for Component 2 (the rapid review of reviews, or REA) \n75 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \nthe synthesis. Only reliable conclusions \nwere synthesised, and reviews with \ngreater relevance to this work were \naccorded more weight than less relevant \nreviews. \n14.4 Synthesis \nThe aim of the final synthesis was bring \ntogether the findings from Components 1 \nand 2. Component 1 formed the \nframework on which Component 2 sat. \nEach completed cell of the matrix (see \nAppendix F) was examined in turn to \nascertain whether there was evidence of \neffective interventions – from Component \n2 – that target the given outcome / risk \nfactor. However, while some \ninterventions clearly target particular risk \nfactors, many are not described in those \nterms and thus, the main structure of the \nsynthesis centres around each outcome \narea. The possibility of cross-cutting \nstrategies was not overlooked, and \nthemes that recur across the matrix were \nalso identified, as was information on \nmulti-component interventions, since \nthese are particularly relevant to TYS. \nThe first stage of the synthesis was to \ngenerate summary tables of each review \nentered into EPPI-Reviewer. We then \nwrote „evidence statements‟ for each \nreview which summarised the context, \nreview question and findings of the \nreview. We then examined the evidence \nstatements across each outcome area and \nwrote a narrative to bring them together. \nSince there is a danger of becoming too \nfar removed from the context of the \nactual studies, examples of interventions \nare also given. \n \n14.5 Interpretation \nAn important part of this work was \ninterpreting the findings and \nunderstanding which aspects might be \nmost important for future policy and \npractice. Discussions with our expert \npanel were critical in giving the wider \ncontext in which this work is located. \nGiven that this is a Rapid Evidence \nAssessment, and not a full systematic \nreview, we also had to ensure that its \nfindings are not over-interpreted. The \nmeeting with our expert panel at the end \nof the REA was designed to discuss its \nfindings and to draw up conclusions and \nrecommendations; these \nrecommendations are reported in full in \nSection 11. \n15    Results: ‘Mapping’ exercise \n76 \nRapid Evidence Assessment of effective early interventions for youth at risk of future poor outcomes \n15 Results: ‘Mapping’ exercise \nThis section contains the results of our first examination of the reviews we identified as \nbeing potentially relevant. The numbers reflect the scope of research reviewing activity in \nthis area. We then narrowed down our scope to examine only the high quality and most \nrelevant reviews – described in the next section. \n15.1  Identified Studies \nIn total, 7,958 references were identified from 16 bibliographic databases, plus further \nhandsearching of websites and citation searches. 2,217 duplicates were removed leaving \n5,741 studies to be screened for relevance to this review.

The search strategy was coded as „stated‟ if the authors described the sources \nof their studies and any keywords or search strings used to locate them, whether they \nsearched published and unpublished material and which these were. The inclusion criteria \nwas coded as „stated‟ if the authors reported on the conditions that a study had to meet in \norder to be part of their analysis, this might be a cut-off date before which a study would \nnot be included, or it might include a decision about the type of intervention that would be \nincluded in the review. The quality assessment criteria was coded as „stated‟ if the authors‟ \nwere explicit about how the review team made decisions about the quality standard of \nstudies to be included in their review. Authors may also report inter-rater reliability \ncoefficients and strategies for reaching consensus between coders where there were \ndisagreements. Finally, data extraction methods was „stated‟ where authors reported on \nany coding tools or guidelines they may have used, and which variables were extracted \nfrom the studies included in their review.  \nSixty-one papers stated each of these elements of a good systematic review and these are \nthe reviews reported in Part I of this report. Approximately half of these reviews were \ncarried out in the USA, with 20 being carried out in the UK. The following table summarises \nthe countries in which the reviews were carried out. \nTable 7: countries in which the included reviews were conducted (not mutually exclusive) \nCountry Number \nCanada 4 \nGermany 1 \nNorway 2 \nThe Netherlands 3 \nUK 20 \nUSA 35 \n  \nThe majority of reviews included interventions that targeted both boys and girls.
